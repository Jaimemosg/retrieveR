available than for indigenous species, which has resulted in the
overwhelming use of exotic species in reforestation (Tolentino,
2008). EDC has been instrumental in the development of a nursery
network for indigenous species across the Philippines: EDC man-
ages its own central nurseries at its geothermal sites across the
country, and each people’s organization with which EDC partners
for its reforestation program establishes a community-managed
satellite nursery. BSBFAI established its nursery with funding and
technical assistance from EDC when it was reactivated in 2011,
and EDC funding continues to support salary for three BSBFAI
members as regular nursery staff. BSBFAI has been awarded special
recognition by the state for outstanding achievement in seedling
production. At a given time, BSBFAI’s nursery may have seedlings
of more than twenty different indigenous species. BSBFAI’s seed-
ling production results in improved access to indigenous species
germplasm for use in its own EDC and NGP sites and more broadly,
since it also produces seedlings for other reforestation projects
across Negros Island. EDC plays a leading role in linking BSBFAI
with buyers and organizing the orders. Seedling production pro-
vides a source of supplemental income to support the livelihoods
of BSBFAI members, who are paid per piece for seedlings produced
for the establishment of BSBFAI reforestation sites and for seed-
lings ordered for projects elsewhere.

Additionally, a failure to address the causes of deforestation has
contributed to the failure of past reforestation programs (Pulhin
et al., 2006). Indeed, long-term survival of planted trees is depen-
dent upon reducing threats to reforestation sites. Proximate
threats to BSBFAI’s reforestation sites include destruction of seed-
lings (primarily by non-BSBFAI members), and fire resulting from
prolonged droughts, which have been a recurring problem in
recent years. EDC has led the effort to capacitate BSBFAI to protect
trees and prevent deforestation in the EDC and NGP sites as well as
in nearby forest areas. EDC organized a patrol group of BSBFAI
members and trained them on how to conduct patrols, monitor
areas, take tree inventories, and identify threats with protocols
for responding to them. The state relies on this same patrol group
for the NGP site, and some trainings have been conducted jointly
by EDC and the state. The members of the patrol group have salary
support primarily from EDC (some from NGP). In addition to carry-
ing out regular patrolling, monitoring, and firefighting in the EDC
and NGP sites and nearby forest areas, the patrol group also main-
tains a water tank and hose system that the nursery depends on
during the dry season.

4. Conclusion

Since community-based forest management is the national
strategy, achieving positive reforestation outcomes to reach the
NGP target depends on identifying successful mechanisms to
capacitate and motivate communities. This is especially challeng-
ing when there is limited experience in community decision-
making and resource management, and in protected areas where
harvesting rights are limited. The experience of BSBFAI illustrates
how increased and longer-term investments in community orga-
nizing and capacity building, including for project management,
nursery management and indigenous seedling production, and
monitoring and protection, have positive impacts for restoring
degraded forestlands with indigenous species in the protected area
context. However, the state faces fiscal and human limitations
making it difficult to achieve the kind of continued activities that
EDC is able to support. The harmonization strategy of the NGP
offers a governance framework to expand public-private partner-
ships that may help achieve the national target not only in terms
of area contributions, but also by improving the outcomes of
community-based efforts.

The impacts of EDC’s reforestation program with BSBFAI go
beyond adding 300 ha toward the national NGP target. All BSBFAI
reforestation projects benefit from improved social capital and
technical capacity, and the production of indigenous species seed-
lings. BSBFAI seedling production increases access to indigenous
species germplasm for reforestation projects across Negros Island
as well. The trained patrol group helps to protect reforestation sites
and nearby forest areas from destruction. EDC has helped BSBFAI
earn a positive reputation, resulting in increased opportunities
for additional projects. Ultimately, the prospects for impact conti-
nuity are improved by: the extended period of community organiz-
ing and capacity building for community-based forest
management, the experience with managing savings and investing
it in community-driven projects, the good performance-project
access feedback, indigenous seedling production being an
income-generating activity, and having a trained community
patrol group. Still, BSBFAI faces significant challenges. The mem-
bers understandably continue to prioritize their individual liveli-
hood needs over community benefits. It remains to be seen
whether BSBFAI will continue to function successfully as a people’s
organization, manage its reforestation sites and community-driven
livelihood projects, maintain its nursery, and continue indigenous
species seedling production without EDC, NGP, or any other pro-
jects with outside funding.
