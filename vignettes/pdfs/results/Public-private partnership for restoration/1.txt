In 2011, the Philippines implemented the National Greening Program (NGP), which aims to reforest all
degraded areas in the Philippines, approximately 7.1 million hectares, by 2028. The NGP includes a har-
monization strategy to coordinate with the wide range of stakeholders involved in reforestation, which
may help to overcome some challenges experienced by earlier programs. This case report discusses
the experience of one people’s organization inside a protected area to assess various impacts of the
public-private partnership with a geothermal company, and outlines how the harmonization strategy
may help achieve the national target not only in terms of area contributions, but also by improving
the outcomes of community-based efforts.

1. Case report

The Philippines is a biodiversity hotspot and a megadiverse
country known for its extensive deforestation, but it also has a his-
tory of state-led initiatives for reforestation and rehabilitation dat-
ing back to the early 1900s (Pulhin et al., 2006). Since the mid-
1970s, there has been increasing multi-sectoral involvement and,
especially since the 1980s, high citizen involvement. In 1995,
community-based forest management was declared the national
strategy for sustainable development of forestlands, giving com-
munities the primary role in forest conservation and reforestation
activities. The strategy was operationalized in the Community-
Based Forest Management Program, under which state-registered
people’s organizations are issued community tenure contracts over
areas wherein they are responsible for forest conservation, and
they gain access to livelihood projects in the form of payments to
carry out planting activities commissioned by the state. Overall,
however, outcomes of past programs have been poor: socioeco-
nomic benefits have been largely limited to short-term payment-
for-labor, sites have often reverted to agricultural land uses after
the end of projects, and the trees most commonly planted have
been fast-growing exotic species (ibid).

In 2011, the Philippines instituted its latest reforestation initia-
tive, the National Greening Program (NGP), led by the Department
of Environment and Natural Resources (henceforth referred to as
‘the state’). The NGP is a target-driven program that originally
aimed to reforest 1.5 million hectares by 2016, and since expanded
to cover all degraded areas in the country, approximately 7.1 mil-
lion hectares, by 2028. The state’s long-standing struggle to bal-
ance poverty alleviation with forest conservation and
reforestation is even more complicated given the scale of the
NGP target since most of the degraded lands are inhabited and in
use by some of the most impoverished people. In line with the for-
est landscape restoration framework, the NGP identifies different
reforestation approaches for different areas to account for different
socioeconomic and environmental objectives: it calls for indige-
nous species to be planted to rehabilitate and restore degraded
forestlands and protected areas, and fruit trees and fast-growing
exotic species to be planted in agroforestry and production areas.
Its strategy for implementation is similar to that of older programs:
the primary responsibility for the establishment and maintenance
of NGP sites lies with people’s organizations whose members are
paid for said activities. For people’s organizations with community
tenure agreements, such as those under the Community-Based
Forest Management Program, they also have management respon-
sibility over the sites through the duration of their tenure contracts
and in exchange they may reap the benefits of permitted harvests
from the plantations, though for sites inside protected areas there
are harvesting restrictions. Given that it takes the same
community-based approach as past efforts, the question is: how
can the NGP achieve better and more sustained outcomes to reach
its target?

One possible pathway to improved outcomes is through the
harmonization strategy of the NGP, which aims to coordinate
activities of the wide range of stakeholders involved in reforesta-
tion efforts (government agencies, private sector, local government
units, and civil society), and bring together all reforestation
