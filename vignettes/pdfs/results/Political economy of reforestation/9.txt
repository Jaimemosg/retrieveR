restoration under REDD+. To avoid the negative results of many
earlier large scale reforestation schemes, REDD+ initiatives will
need to incorporate the following principles.

8.1. Rights-based spatial planning

As planning processes are carried out to identify areas where
REDD+ may support reforestation and forest restoration activities,
it will be essential that these be structured in a manner that explic-
itly addresses the rights of local communities. In particular, an ap-
proach will be needed to resolve competing claims between rural
communities managing land and forest resources under customary
tenure systems, on the one hand, and state agencies and private
sector actors relying on national legal codes, on the other. Propo-
nents of REDD+ can support participatory and accountable plan-
ning processes by committing to the principles of free, prior, and
informed consent on the part of affected rural communities before
REDD+-funded spatial planning processes and reforestation pro-
jects are approved and funded (Colchester, 2010). Community
involvement in the spatial planning process can be strengthened
through the use of participatory mapping of lands and forest re-
sources managed under customary tenure systems.

For REDD+ to succeed, forest and land rights for rural communi-
ties must be clear and must be defendable under national law. Gi-
ven the diversity of institutional arrangements and the large
number of claims being made, achieving clear rights in situations
which have hitherto been governed under informal common prop-
erty regimes will undoubtedly take time and resources. If it is to be
fair, the process must not be hurried and must be supported by
technical resources and funding. Given the fundamental impor-
tance of clear land and property rights in achieving desirable forest
outcomes, it is justified to use REDD+ funds to support broader
processes of tenure reform and rationalization of state-controlled
forest zones.

8.2. Equitable and accountable distribution of financial incentives

As mechanisms are created to distribute financial incentives
through REDD+, care will need to be taken to ensure that they pro-
mote the equitable distribution of the program’s benefits and not
allow these to be captured disproportionately by the sector’s most
powerful actors. Doing so will necessarily require the design of
financial disbursement mechanisms to support the flow of REDD+
payments to participating rural communities, rather than channel-
ing them primarily through large-scale plantation companies or
project developers, who often have close ties to state elites. Funds
may also be used to support pro-poor policy measures such as par-
ticipatory planning processes and the strengthening of tenure
rights for rural communities and small-holders.

To ensure accountability, it will be important for legitimate rep-
resentatives of forest peoples’ organizations, rural community
groups, and civil society institutions to be involved in the design
and implementation of such mechanisms, and for these processes
to be carried out in a transparent and participatory manner from
the outset. Moreover, institutions administering REDD+ funds
must conduct robust due diligence to help ensure that all recipi-
ents of REDD+ payments are likely to meet their obligations during
the commitment period. Assessments of prior performance of
plantation companies that received reforestation subsidies under
previous initiatives can help determine whether they are reliable
partners under REDD+.

8.3. Improved financial governance to prevent corruption and fraud

For REDD+ to succeed, it will be essential that funds allocated to
support reforestation and forest restoration activities (and other
forest-related mitigation activities) be administered in an account-
able manner and utilized for their intended purpose. To minimize
the loss of funds to corruption and fraud, countries and agencies
participating in REDD+ will need to ensure that the institutions
established to administer program funds have adequate capacity
to meet international standards for good financial governance. In
addition to capacity for budgeting, accounting, and fiscal adminis-
tration, this must include robust ‘checks and balances’, including
strong internal financial controls and routine external audits to en-
sure that funds are properly managed.

Moreover, it is critical that REDD+ recipient countries demon-
strate strong political will and budgetary support for government
institutions involved in the prevention and mitigation of forest
and carbon-related corruption. These include, for instance, dedi-
cated anti-corruption agencies and financial crimes units in both
the executive and judicial branches of government. Support for
these agencies can be strengthened through collaboration with
international institutions and governments in other jurisdictions,
as well as civil society organizations focusing on transparency
and accountability issues.

8.4. Policy reform to remove perverse incentives for forest conversion

If REDD+ is to succeed in mitigating forest-related carbon emis-
sions and enhancing forest carbon stocks, policies supporting per-
verse incentives for forest conversion must be changed. It is
particularly important that reforestation initiatives not be used
to justify the large-scale clearing of areas that still have significant
forest cover, recognizing that such areas are often classified as ‘de-
graded’ secondary forest. This can be achieved by making forestry
departments’ spatial planning processes more transparent and
opening land-use planning decisions to public review. REDD+
financing for reforestation and forest restoration activities should
be restricted to projects that do not involve the removal of natural
forest cover prior to replanting, and adequate mechanisms for
measuring, reporting, and verification (MRV) should be put in place
to ensure this is the case.

In addition, there is a need for improved monitoring and
enforcement of timber concession regulations to ensure that con-
cession-holders are not intentionally over-harvesting their selec-
tive logging sites in order to have these areas reclassified as
‘degraded forest’ eligible for conversion. In jurisdictions where
taxes and levies on wood harvested through land-clearing opera-
tions are artificially low, governments should raise the rates and
improve collection of these fees in order to remove a strong eco-
nomic incentive driving forest conversion.

8.5. Strengthening of economic benefits and safeguards for small-
holders

To the extent that REDD+ supports the enhancement of carbon
stocks through reforestation and forest restoration, there is a
pressing need to structure these initiatives so that they will sup-
port the livelihoods and well-being of rural smallholders. Funda-
mentally, this must involve the prioritization of tree-planting
programs that support not only the participation of, but more
importantly, the flow of benefits to rural households and commu-
nities. This will require the design of effective institutional mech-
anisms to ensure that farmers choosing to participate in such
programs are able to negotiate with both corporate actors and
state agencies in a fair and equitable manner, and that all parties
to any agreements can be held mutually accountable.

In addition, it will be essential for rigorous and independent so-
cial impact assessments to be conducted before REDD+ projects are
initiated, and for regular monitoring of social and economic im-
pacts to be carried out as the program is being implemented.
