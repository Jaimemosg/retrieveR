(BPP) mill project in the early-2000s. To secure lands for the devel-
opment of a 750,000 tonne/year kraft pulp mill and a 200,000 ha
plantation base, the company sought to relocate several thousand
Iban Dayak villagers, including some 1800 individuals living in
twelve longhouses along the River Tatau in Bintulu District.
According to Barney (2007), the affected communities were offered
compensation by the plantation company, but the process through
which this was negotiated was highly inequitable and provided
few guarantees for their livelihood security:

For the Iban longhouse communities living along the River
Tatau, the resettlement scheme was initiated through a com-
pany-led program in which, though the subject of regular visits
by company negotiators, the longhouse inhabitants feel they
have little control or negotiating position.. . . A major issue of
contention for members of the three longhouses facing immedi-
ate resettlement was the future security of their landholdings
on the opposite bank of the river. One tuai rumah (headman)
in particular feared that once they accepted the resettlement
plan and moved to [the relocation site 150 km away], they
would be unable to maintain their dispersed pulau holdings
(often high-quality longhouse forest reserves, managed for local
timber, non-timber, and hunting purposes). The longhouses
claimed that timber companies had already extracted much of
the timber from the pulau without paying compensation. Others
feared the remaining lands might be seized by other oil palm
plantation companies if they were forced to leave. The fact that
the Land and Survey Department entered and surveyed land
belonging to the longhouse groups without permission, and
the company then cleared land without first agreeing to com-
pensation, both in violation of longhouse adat [customary
law], has resulted in loss of confidence concerning the good
faith of state agencies and company negotiators.
4 According to Saxena (1997) ‘‘In terms of simply amount of planting of new trees,
the Social Forestry programme has been immensely successful. Between 1980 and
1987, the Government claims to have grown 18,865 million trees (Chambers et al.,
1989). If the estimate of survival of 60% is taken as correct (IIPO, 1991), and taking the
number of villages as 580,000, the average number of surviving new trees per village
comes to nearly 19,500.’’
Although members of some longhouses accepted the company’s
resettlement package, many did not. As Barney (2007) notes, this
resulted in several Iban communities taking up active resistance
against the BPP pulp mill and plantation project, including pro-
tests, road blockades, and legal action to defend their land rights
in state courts.

Confrontations between rural communities and plantation
companies have, in some circumstances, led to violent conflicts.
Harwell (2003) documents a series of attacks on villagers in Indo-
nesia’s Riau Province carried out between 1997 and 2002 by the
Mobile Brigade (Brimob) of the National Police Force and private
security contractors working with Asia Pulp & Paper (APP)’s parent
conglomerate, the Sinar Mas Group. In one instance, Harwell de-
scribes villagers being subject to ‘‘violent attacks by organized
mobs of hundreds of club-wielding company enforcers, trained
by and sometimes accompanied by state police,’’ following com-
munity protests to prevent their eviction from lands the company
wanted to plant (Harwell, 2003). Civil society organizations Watch
Indonesia! and WALHI (2008) describe a more recent incident in
December 2008, in which security forces working with an APP-
affiliated plantation company used violence to remove local people
from disputed land. To force community members to leave the
land, they report, ‘‘Hundreds of police and paramilitaries attacked
the Sumatran village Suluk Bongkal in Riau Province with tear gas
and guns [and] a helicopter dropped incendiary devices on the vil-
lage’’ (Watch Indonesia! and WALHI, 2008, cited in Barr et al.
(2010)). In a statement released following the incident, APP re-
ported that these actions had been taken to prevent ‘‘ongoing
destruction of the existing plantation area’’ by members of the Riau
Farmers Union (Sarikat Petani Riau) and claimed that ‘‘the Riau Po-
lice. . . had followed legal and appropriate procedures’’ (APP, Janu-
ary 20, 2009).
7. Opportunities and challenges for rural livelihoods

In spite of the challenges they frequently pose, reforestation ini-
tiatives and other types of tree-planting schemes are often pro-
moted as being potential catalysts for economic development
and poverty alleviation in rural areas. In Asia–Pacific and other re-
gions, governments, multilateral development banks, and bilateral
donor agencies have advanced various models for engaging upland
communities in tree-planting activities. These range from partner-
ships between local communities and commercial plantation com-
panies, on the one hand, to programs aimed at promoting
reforestation activities by groups of small-holders either on their
own land or on state-controlled forest land. It is commonly antic-
ipated that such initiatives will generate a host of benefits for rural
communities, including employment and wage labor; access to
credit; the provision of low-cost seeds, fertilizer and other inputs;
and in the case of commercial tree-planting programs, a ready
market for the wood produced (Lamb, 2011).

In India, the national government has promoted tree-planting by
rural smallholders since 1976, when it launched an extensive social
forestry program (Saxena, 1997). Through the late-1980s, the pro-
gram’s main objective was to relieve pressure on state-controlled
forests by encouraging farmers to grow trees on village and private
lands. The program catalyzed widespread tree-planting on pri-
vately-owned farms, particularly in regions with wood industries.4

In most of the country, however, social forestry failed to achieve its
planting targets on village lands (Saxena, 1997; Kumar et al., 2000).
India’s social forestry projects were often hindered by tenure uncer-
tainties and non-participatory decision-making processes, which left
most of the authority for planning and implementation in the hands
of state forestry departments. As Saxena (1997) concludes:

Community plantations in fact, whatever the theory, have usu-
ally been bureaucratic impositions on villages. Participation has
been limited, at best confined to a few members of a village
elite. Community members, especially the poor, have not
accepted these plantations as their own. People’s involvement
has been limited to the handing over of common lands to the
Department and to wage employment. They have otherwise
remained passive spectators of the raising of trees on their land
(SIDA, 1990, cited in Saxena (1997)).

India’s Forestry Department adopted a program of Joint Forest
Management (JFM) in 1988 and began collaborating with commu-
nity groups in the protection and regeneration of forests under
state control (Saxena, 1997). With assistance from the World Bank
and other international donors, many JFM projects have taken a
two-pronged approach: on the one hand, ‘‘increasing the stake of
the neighboring communities in the management and utilization
of the forests,’’ and, on the other hand, ‘‘creating alternative
sources of employment to reduce the pressure on forests,’’ includ-
ing through tree-planting and regeneration of degraded lands (Ku-
mar et al., 2000). Joint Forest Management is widely credited with
expanding the usufruct rights of local villagers to state-managed
forests and forestlands. However, the extent to which tree-planting
projects under JFM have generated tangible benefits for economi-
cally marginalized groups – including women and the rural poor
– has often depended on local power relations and the structure
of the community groups involved (Sarin, 2003; Sekher, 2001; Ku-
mar et al., 2000).
