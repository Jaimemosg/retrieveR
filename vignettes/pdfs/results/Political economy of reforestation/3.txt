such areas reclassified so that they can be used for other purposes,
such as mining or agro-industrial plantations. In countries with
decentralized political systems, these areas can also be the subject
of intense political struggles between government agencies at the
national and sub-national levels, which invariably revolve around
intra-institutional competition over revenue flows.1 On the ground,
state forestry bureaucracies often find themselves pitted in conflicts
with rural communities over issues of access to and control over for-
est resources, and these conflicts can be particularly intense on ‘de-
graded’ forest lands.

Within these contexts, state forestry bureaucracies use refores-
tation and forest restoration programs as strategies to consolidate
and, in some cases, to extend their territorial reach. In the face of
competition from other government agencies, forestry depart-
ments can rarely make a more compelling case for continued
administrative control over ‘degraded’ lands than by putting these
areas back under tree cover. Successful implementation of refores-
tation programs can demonstrate a forestry bureau’s technical
competence, while the restoration of trees – if not a fully function-
ing forest ecosystem – on a landscape can reaffirm its status as
‘state forest’ within the national spatial plan. A forestry ministry’s
political and economic clout can be bolstered further by the
fiscal flows associated with the regeneration of commercially
productive forests, thereby reinforcing its claims to state budgetary
allocations.

3. Rent transfer to political and corporate elites

Governments in forest-rich countries of Asia–Pacific historically
have transferred substantial economic rents through the allocation
of timber concessions to companies affiliated with political and
military elites (Ross, 2001). For state powerholders, these practices
have served multiple purposes by solidifying political loyalty from
key individuals and institutions, while also generating lucrative
economic profits for their own family members and business asso-
ciates (Brown, 1999). Forestry ministries have also used their con-
trol over the allocation of forest rents – a process Ross has termed
‘rent seizing’ – to assert and maintain a prominent place in the
political economic hierarchy of state institutions (Ross, 2001).

As selective logging concessions have declined, however, state
rent transfer strategies in some countries have been adapted and
repackaged through reforestation programs. Government forestry
departments commonly distribute reforestation-related rents
through the allocation of three types of assets:

(1) Commercial plantation licenses.
(2) Access to residual wood.
(3) Capital subsidies.

3.1. Commercial plantation licenses

Across Asia–Pacific, forestry ministries have scheduled tens of
millions of hectares within state-controlled forest zones for con-
version to industrial timber and wood-fiber plantations. Through
the allocation of commercial plantation licenses, they have as-
signed operational control over large portions of these areas to
both state-owned and privately-owned forestry companies. In
many countries, government regulations allow companies holding
plantation licenses to exercise legal authority over the areas in
question for several decades or more. In Indonesia, for instance,
1 Awareness of the harmful impacts of the lack of clarity over institutional
responsibilities for forests is however achieving prominence in the forest discourse –
President Yudhoyono of Indonesia has flagged this issue as a leading obstacle to the
achievement of his country’s emissions reductions target (Jakarta Post, September 30,
2011).
current regulations provide plantation license-holders with the
right to develop and manage the areas assigned to them for
100 years, with the possibility of renewal at the end of the license
period.

For plantation companies, the state’s provision of long-term
control over large tracts of productive land endows them with a
major competitive advantage in increasingly regional and global
commodity supply chains. In growing parts of Asia–Pacific, compa-
nies receiving plantation licenses have established expansive
monocultures of fast-growing tree plantations, often using exotic
genera such as Eucalyptus or Acacia managed on short rotations
of 5–7 years (Cossalter and Pye-Smith, 2003). On well-managed
sites with appropriate species selection, some companies have
established highly productive plantations which are among the
world’s lowest cost sources of wood fiber. To a very significant de-
gree, the rapid expansion of ‘fastwood’ plantations in Asia–Pacific
has been driven by skyrocketing demand for pulp and paper and
other wood products in China and by projected future demand
growth in both China and India (Barr and Stafford, 2009).

With both countries facing significant shortfalls in domestic
wood fiber supply, transnational pulp and paper companies have
sought to secure low-cost fiber sources by establishing fast-grow-
ing plantations in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and
Laos, as well as within China. In some cases, plantation develop-
ment has been integrated with multi-billion dollar investments
in wood pulp mills; while in other cases, it has been oriented to-
wards the export of pulplogs or wood chips. In this way, transna-
tional investment strategies and commodity flows have a very
direct effect in shaping land-use practices in forest landscapes
across the region. Describing the dynamics of these processes in
Laos, Barney (2008) notes that ‘‘significant economic imperatives
and commodity relations . . . have become intimately involved in
‘defining degradation’ and thus transforming . . . upland forest
spaces.’’
3.2. Access to residual wood

Governments routinely allow plantation companies to clear and
utilize the residual timber, wood fiber, and biomass from sites des-
ignated for reforestation and plantation development. Although
these areas are generally classified as ‘degraded’ forests or ‘waste-
lands’, it is sometimes the case that the standing stock of mer-
chantable timber and wood fiber is still quite valuable (Meijard
and Sheil, 2007). This is often particularly so in former selective
logging concessions which have been scheduled for conversion
and in areas within a commercial distance of pulp mills and other
wood processing facilities. It is frequently the case that the levies
governments place on timber and pulpwood harvested from
land-clearing sites are substantially lower than those associated
with selective logging concessions. In this way, forestry companies
are able to capture sizeable economic rents on the wood they har-
vest through land-clearing, as long as they are able to get the wood
to market.

In Indonesia, it has been estimated that commercial plantation
companies cleared approximately 1.3 million ha of land with vary-
ing densities of forest cover during the 1990s. The companies were
required to pay only nominal fees for wood harvested through
land-clearing activities, as the Ministry of Forestry set levies at
rates that were (and continue to be) well below stumpage value.
For small-diameter pulpwood, for instance, government levies
amounted to less than US$ 2.00 per tonne. Depending on assump-
tions used regarding the average commercial volume of the stand-
ing stock, it has been estimated that the companies obtained
timber and wood fiber from these sites with a market value of be-
tween US$ 908 million and US$ 2.7 billion (Barr et al., 2010).
