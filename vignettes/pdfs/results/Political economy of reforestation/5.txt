approximately US$ 200 million per year (Barr et al., 2010). Over the
past two decades, the Government has collected an estimated US$
6.2 billion in aggregate revenues from the reforestation levy.

Until the end of the Soeharto regime in 1998, the Ministry of
Forestry held full administrative authority over the Reforestation
Fund, which it managed as a discretionary financing facility out-
side the state budget (Barr et al., 2010). An independent audit con-
ducted by Ernst and Young in 1999 found that the Ministry
managed the fund in a highly non-transparent manner, using
accounting practices and fiduciary controls that fell well short of
international norms (Ernst and Young, 1999). Such practices made
the Reforestation Fund vulnerable to misappropriation of funds by
corrupt officials and irregular disbursements for uses that had little
relation to reforestation and forest rehabilitation. During the
1990s, the Ministry disbursed at least US$ 600 million to finance
politically favoured projects, many of which were linked to the
President’s family or close business associates (Ascher, 1999).
These included, for instance, allocations of US$ 190 million to a
state-owned aircraft company and US$ 250 million for the contro-
versial ‘One Million Hectare Peatland Development Project’ in Cen-
tral Kalimantan.

During the 1990s, the Ministry of Forestry allocated approxi-
mately US$ 1.0 billion from the Reforestation Fund in cash grants
and discounted loans to promote reforestation through the devel-
opment of industrial timber plantations (Ernst and Young, 1999).
Approximately two-thirds of this amount was allocated to ten for-
estry companies closely affiliated with the Soeharto family and the
Indonesian military (Barr et al., 2010). Several of the companies
receiving the subsidies are alleged to have engaged in fraud to in-
crease the size of the subsidies they received. In various cases, they
did so by ‘marking up’ their investment costs; over-stating the
areas they planted; and diverting disbursements from the Refores-
tation Fund for purposes other than plantation development (Ernst
and Young, 1999) Such fraudulent practices allowed a handful of
powerful actors to secure enormous profits, while providing few
long-term public benefits in terms of reforestation or plantation
development.

Altogether, Ernst and Young (1999) documented some US$
5.2 billion in losses from the Reforestation Fund through the end
of the Soeharto era in 1998. Approximately half of these losses
were attributed to the Ministry’s failure to collect the reforestation
levy at adequate levels, while the remainder was associated with
financial mismanagement after the revenues had entered the Min-
istry’s accounts. During the post-Soeharto period, the Government
of Indonesia has taken important steps to administer the Refores-
tation Fund in a more transparent and accountable manner (Barr
et al., 2010). Nevertheless, ongoing weaknesses in financial man-
agement and revenue administration have meant that reforesta-
tion and forest restoration initiatives in many parts of the
country continue to fall well short of their objectives.

4.2. Case of Sino-Forest Corporation

Recent regulatory actions taken against Sino-Forest Corporation
by the Ontario Securities Commission underscore the fact that
reforestation-related fraud is not limited to mismanagement of
government-run forestry funds. Incorporated in 1994 and listed
on the Toronto Stock Exchange since 1995, Sino-Forest has ex-
panded rapidly over the past 17 years to become one of the largest
operators of commercial forestry holdings in China. According to
company reports, Sino-Forest ‘‘operates and manages approxi-
mately 894,200 ha of plantations (as at June 30, 2011) and down-
stream manufacturing operations spanning eleven key provinces
across China’’ (Sino Forest website, October 11, 2011). The com-
pany has also set ambitious expansion targets, projecting that its
annual planting will increase from 19,000 ha in 2009 to
200,000 ha in 2013; and that its overall fiber output will more than
double from 14.2 million cubic meters (m3) in 2009 to 30.0 million
m3 in 2013 (Sino Forest website, October 11, 2011).

Arguing that it is strategically positioned to supply China’s rap-
idly growing demand for commercial timber and wood fiber, Sino
Forest has raised several billion dollars from international inves-
tors over the past decade. It has done so through a series of equity
offerings and debt issues, several of which have been facilitated by
leading investment banks such as Credit Suisse, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley. Sino Forest reported that its
market capitalization at the end of 2010 was US$ 5.7 billion (Sino
Forest website, October 11, 2011).

In August 2011, the Ontario Securities Commission halted trad-
ing in Sino Forest’s shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (OSC,
2011). This action by Canada’s top securities regulator came several
weeks after a US-based financial research firm released an analysis
of Sino Forest’s operations alleging that it has ‘‘engaged in aggres-
sive fraud from the time it went public’’ (Block, 2011). The report,
by Muddy Waters LLC, asserts that Sino Forest has fraudulently in-
flated its profits by maintaining ‘‘a convoluted structure whereby it
claims to run most of its revenues through ‘authorized intermediar-
ies’’’ (Block, 2011). According to Muddy Waters, Sino Forest has
used this model ‘‘to invent sales figures’’ for fictive transactions,
supposedly involving the buying and selling of logs and standing
timber, in which the company ‘‘risked no capital and moved no
physical goods’’ (Block, 2011). The report notes that Sino Forest de-
clines to identify all but one of these intermediaries, and the one it
does identify appears to be an affiliated company.

The Muddy Waters report further alleges that Sino Forest ‘‘mas-
sively exaggerates its assets’’ (Block, 2011). In particular, the report
calls into question Sino Forest’s claim that it has purchased US$
2.891 billion in standing timber plantations since 2006. It suggests
that the Sino Forest’s contracted forestry holdings are substantially
less than the areas and volumes reported by the company and that
in some provinces, the company has apparently overstated its pur-
chases of forest lands from local agents. In particular, the Muddy
Waters report claims that Sino Forest ‘‘overstated purchases from
[its] Yunnan agent. . . by approximately [US]$ 800 million’’ (Block,
2011). Sino Forest has allegedly used such practices to channel il-
licit proceeds to undisclosed subsidiaries which then move the
funds offshore to some 20 affiliated entities domiciled in the Brit-
ish Virgin Islands (Block, 2011). Describing the company as a ‘‘mul-
ti-billion dollar Ponzi scheme,’’ the Muddy Waters report notes
that ‘‘Sino Forest to date has raised over [US]$ 3.05 billion from
the capital markets and has not paid a cent back from free cash
flow, nor has it paid a dividend’’ (Block, 2011).

Not surprisingly, Sino Forest has strongly denied these allega-
tions, arguing that the Muddy Waters report is an aggressive effort
on the part of a short-seller to undermine the company’s share va-
lue. To address the allegations, Sino Forest has retained the multi-
national auditing firm PriceWaterhouse Coopers to assist an
‘independent committee’ of company directors in reviewing the
activities and business of Sino Forest and its subsidiaries. In its final
report, issued in January 2012, the committee concluded it could
not independently verify several of the core claims made by the
company. Noting ‘‘there remain issues which have not been fully
answered,’’ the committee reported that ‘‘‘‘much of the informa-
tion which it is seeking lies with non-compellable third parties,
may not exist or is apparently not retrievable from the records of
the Company’’ (Independent Committee, 2012).

The Ontario Securities Commission’s decision to take regulatory
action, which was reportedly based on information provided by
Sino Forest’s independent committee, appears to broadly affirm
several of the allegations against the company. In its order to halt
trading of Sino Forest shares, issued on August 26, 2011, the
Commission states that its own investigation has found:
