Under REDD+, the enhancement of carbon stocks through reforestation and restoration of degraded forest
landscapes offers considerable potential benefits. In the Asia–Pacific region, however, many previous
reforestation and forest restoration initiatives have exacerbated existing inequities by concentrating
resources among powerful political and economic actors, often to the detriment of forest-dependent
communities. Both in design and implementation, tree-planting programs have been guided by forest
rent distribution practices of state forestry bureaucracies and by corporate accumulation strategies
linked to increasingly globalized commodity chains.

This article examines the political economy of reforestation and forest restoration programs in Asia–
Pacific and highlights governance challenges these pose. In various contexts, they have:

� consolidated the control of state agencies and corporate actors over ‘degraded’ forest landscapes,
often resulting in the displacement of rural communities;
� exacerbated economic disparities by channeling large capital subsidies and resource rents to compa-

nies with close ties to state elites;
� facilitated corruption and financial fraud, in some cases on a grand scale;
� accelerated biodiversity loss by creating perverse incentives for the conversion of ‘degraded’ second-

ary forests; and
� generated mixed results for rural small-holders, at times locking them in inequitable agreements with

plantation companies, and in other cases, offering enhanced tenure security.

To avoid the negative results of earlier reforestation schemes, REDD+ must incorporate: (1) rights-
based spatial planning; (2) equitable and accountable distribution of financial incentives; (3) improved
financial governance to prevent corruption and fraud; (4) policy reform to remove perverse incentives
for forest conversion; (5) strengthening of economic benefits and safeguards for small-holders.

1. Introduction

The crisis of global climate change has focused unprecedented
attention on the rapid pace of deforestation and forest degradation,
which account for a significant yet disputed portion of human-in-
duced greenhouse gas emissions (Stern, 2006). Under the UN-led
initiative known as REDD+, the international community is seeking
to design mechanisms to compensate developing countries for
reducing forest-related carbon emissions. Thus far, these efforts
have focused heavily on funding policies and practices aimed at
slowing the loss of forest cover associated with forest extraction
and land-use change. However, in many countries likely to

participate in REDD+, these efforts have encountered considerable
resistance from stakeholders currently benefitting from high rates
for forest exploitation and conversion.

Increasingly, proponents of REDD+ are also promoting the
enhancement of carbon stocks through reforestation and restora-
tion of degraded forest landscapes. In principle, the provision of
financial incentives to encourage the restoration and regeneration
of forests has much to offer. Most directly, many developing coun-
tries have extensive areas of forestland that have become degraded
through logging, agricultural expansion, or fires, and often by a
combination of the three. REDD+ payments could provide a unique
source of financing for forest-based activities that would transform
these areas into revenue-generating carbon sinks. Reforestation
and forest restoration could also provide significant co-benefits.
These might include, for instance, income opportunities for rural
households; enhancement of biodiversity conservation; and more
