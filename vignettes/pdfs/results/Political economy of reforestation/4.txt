3.3. Capital subsidies

As in other regions, many Asia–Pacific governments have also
provided substantial direct and indirect capital subsidies to pro-
mote reforestation and plantation development. Depending on
the country, direct subsidies have included cash grants, discounted
loans from state banks, tax breaks, and subsidized seedlings, fertil-
izer, and other inputs. In addition, plantation companies have also
frequently benefitted from government fuel subsidies, infrastruc-
ture development linking rural areas to markets, and investments
in research and development (to improve, for instance, the quality
of the genetic material available for tree-planting initiatives).

In China, for instance, the national government has allocated
some US$ 8.6 billion (RMB 71.8 billion) in financial subsidies to
support the development of 13.3 million ha of commercial tree
plantations during the period 2001–2015 (AF&PA, 2004).2 Under
this plan, the State Forest Administration has identified 99 priority
plantation projects to be carried out by state forest farms, private
companies, and farmers’ cooperatives which are eligible to receive
discounted financing (Barr and Cossalter, 2004). Program subsidies
are structured as follows:

� State policy banks provide 70% the program’s total financing
through the provision of loans with reduced interest rates and
extended repayment periods (10–15 years).
� The Ministry of Finance distributes 20% of program financing

through loan interest subsidies.
� Local governments cover 3% of program costs.
� Entities receiving government financial subsidies are expected

to cover 7% of program costs through commercial loans or
equity contributions.

Governments providing subsidies for reforestation and planta-
tion development have offered various rationales to justify the
use of public funds in this way. They have frequently claimed that
forestry companies require incentives to carry out tree-planting
activities on degraded lands and that subsidies help forestry com-
panies to reduce economic risk by lowering capital costs (Bull et al.,
2006). They have also argued that private sector financial institu-
tions are often reluctant to finance reforestation and forest restora-
tion activities on a commercial basis, and state assistance is,
therefore, necessary to catalyze investments in such projects.

Meanwhile, critics argue that government subsidies distort
markets by artificially reducing the cost of capital, giving subsidy
recipients an unfair advantage over plantation companies or other
land-users who do not have access to such support (Bull et al.,
2006). Not infrequently, reforestation and plantation subsidies
have been allocated disproportionately to companies with close
connections to state elites, thereby reinforcing existing patronage
structures and exacerbating inequities within the forestry sector
(Barr et al., 2010). In some cases, the allocation of subsidies to pro-
mote reforestation and plantation development has been accom-
panied by a significant degree of moral hazard, as companies
receiving support apparently have less incentive to ensure their
sites are managed productively, as less of their own money is at
risk. Moreover, as described below, the allocation of capital subsi-
dies to forestry and plantation companies can also result in sub-
stantial losses of public funds when effective mechanisms to
ensure financial accountability are not in place.
2 Although this figure is quite substantial, it must be noted that it represents only a
fraction of the US$ 30 billion that the Chinese government has budgeted for
reforestation and afforestation under its Sloping Land Conversion Program (Grossjean
and Kontoleon, 2009).
4. Corruption and financial fraud

In forest-rich countries of Asia–Pacific, as in other regions, weak
legal-regulatory institutions coupled with the availability of lucra-
tive resource rents have facilitated widespread corruption and
fraud within the sector. In many countries, forest-related corrup-
tion is prevalent at all levels, ranging from a Minister receiving
bribes to allocate timber concession licenses (‘grand corruption’)
to local forestry officials accepting payments to turn a blind eye
to timber harvesting in protected areas (‘petty corruption’). In
the absence of effective law enforcement, forestry companies also
sometimes engage in fraudulent practices to secure illicit profits
well above the legal earnings from their operations. Under-report-
ing of harvested volumes, transfer pricing, and a broad array of
other practices are widely used to capture rents that would other-
wise accrue to the state.

The considerable financial and material incentives that govern-
ments have mobilized to promote reforestation and forest restora-
tion activities‘ have frequently made these initiatives particularly
susceptible to corruption and fraud. In many countries, govern-
ments have established national forestry funds dedicated to
financing reforestation and other aspects of sectoral development,
and these have generally been placed under the administrative
control of forestry ministries or their functional equivalents. A re-
view of 40 national forest funds conducted by the UN Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO) in 2001 found, however, that for-
estry departments frequently have only limited capacity for finan-
cial governance and that such funds are often administered with
low levels of transparency and external accountability (Rosenbaum
and Lindsay, 2001).

In some cases, poor accounting practices and weak financial
oversight have meant that funds earmarked for reforestation and
forest restoration have not been used for their intended purpose
(cf. Barr et al., 2010). Forestry departments have sometimes di-
verted these funds to cover other priorities within their own bud-
gets, while in other cases they have channeled reforestation
revenues to support projects and political activities outside the for-
estry sector. More commonly, perhaps, senior forestry officials
have often been able to exercise high levels of discretionary control
over how such funds are allocated. This has enabled them to chan-
nel disbursements to companies with close ties to state elites and
has made such funds vulnerable to misappropriation by corrupt
officials.

The scope and dynamics of reforestation-related corruption and
fraud are illustrated by the cases of Indonesia’s Reforestation Fund
and recent regulatory actions taken against Sino-Forest Corpora-
tion, a Toronto-listed plantation company with forestry holdings
in China.
4.1. Indonesia’s Reforestation Fund3

The Government of Indonesia established the nation’s Refores-
tation Fund (Dana Reboisasi) in 1989 with the stated mandate of
financing reforestation and rehabilitation of degraded forest lands.
Funded by a volume-based levy on selective-logging timber con-
cessions, the fund quickly emerged as the largest source of state
revenues from Indonesia’s forestry sector. At its peak in the mid-
1990s, receipts from the Reforestation Fund amounted to over
US$ 500 million annually, and the fund continues to generate
