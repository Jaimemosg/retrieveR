16 C.M. Barr, J.A. Sayer / Biological Conservation 154 (2012) 9–19
In other countries across the region, governments and multilat-
eral institutions have sought to encourage small-holders to partic-
ipate in tree-planting initiatives and to manage reforestation sites
over the long-term by providing them with enhanced access and
tenure security. In China, for instance, the government has pro-
moted participation in its Sloping Land Conversion Program by
offering mechanisms for participating farmers to secure long-term
property rights over the areas on which they plant trees. A recent
review of the program has found that the opportunity to gain more
secure tenure far outpaced other incentives, including cash subsi-
dies, in attracting the sustained participation of rural households.
Summarizing their findings from Guizhou Province, for example,
Grossjean and Kontoleon (2009) conclude that:

Households. . . would be willing to maintain reforested lands
even if hardly any direct subsidies are offered provided that
they receive enhanced tenure and renting rights over their
reforested lands as well as improved usage rights that would
allow for the uninhibited selection and management of planted
tree types as well as their full commercial exploitation.

Similarly, in Vietnam the government has encouraged small-
holders to participate in its Five Million Hectare Reforestation Pro-
gram by giving farmer groups extended use rights to state forest
land, as well as access to finance and other inputs (Sikor, 2001,
2011). While devolution of forest rights has been a strong factor
motivating farmer participation, however, this formalization of
new tenure arrangements has, in some cases, restricted access to
economically important resources for women and ‘the poorest of
the poor’ (McElwee, 2009; Clement and Amezaga, 2009).

For plantation companies and wood industries, mutually bene-
ficial partnerships with local stakeholders carry the promise of en-
hanced profits through long-term stability of commercial
operations (Nawir et al., 2003). In several Asia–Pacific countries,
partnerships between rural small-holders private forestry compa-
nies have had highly variable impacts and, in some contexts, have
posed significant risks for participating communities. Reviews of
these experiences in China and Indonesia have shown that partic-
ipating villagers often have little leverage in negotiating agree-
ments with plantation companies, which in many cases have the
backing of forestry departments and other state agencies (cf Lu
et al., 2002; Mayer and Vermeulen, 2002). Moreover, once agree-
ments are reached, small-holders frequently have few mechanisms
to ensure accountability on the part of the companies. In a review
of company-community partnerships in Indonesia, Nawir et al.
(2003) note that several companies negotiated their agreements
with local elites, leaving most participating villagers unsure of
what they had committed to:

The companies had dominant roles and did not commonly use
participatory approaches to socialize or deliver information
about rights and responsibilities to the wider tree-grower audi-
ences. Tree-growers commonly only had a general understand-
ing or were confused about the content of the agreement. . .
Furthermore, a copy of the contract was not provided to the
tree-growers in most of the case study locations. The few copies
of the contract document and contractual agreement were pro-
vided only to the Head of Dusun (sub-village) or the Head of the
Farmer Group.

In southern China, commercial plantation companies have
sometimes used third-party brokers to negotiate land rental con-
tracts and out-grower agreements with local communities. A
2010 case study of Stora Enso’s activities in Guangxi Province, for
instance, describes the Scandinavian pulp and paper producer as
relying heavily on brokers to secure 120,000 ha to support its fiber
supply for a planned kraft pulp mill project in that province. The
report alleges, however, that the brokers sometimes used strong-
arm tactics to pressure farmers’ cooperatives to enter into long-
term lease agreements with the company, in apparent violation
of Stora Enso’s own corporate social responsibility commitments:

Extensive fieldwork indicates that the legal procedure was not
followed for the acquisition of both household forestland rights
and rights to collective-managed forestland. Due to a lack of
public notice and approval by collective members, many farm-
ers have been completely unaware of the transfer terms. A
widespread lack of documentation further limits public knowl-
edge and clarity. In some cases farmers were even deceived or
physically threatened into transfer deals. Systems for notifica-
tion and resolution of disputes have been unavailable or inade-
quate. It appears that Stora Enso’s primary dependence on
government power under the guise of middlemen to acquire
collective forestland rights is largely to blame for these viola-
tions (Ping and Neilsen, 2010).

Where mechanisms for mutual accountability are absent, ineq-
uitable land-rental contracts and out-grower agreements can
have extremely detrimental effects for rural small-holders (Coss-
alter and Barr, 2005). Indeed, plantation companies and brokers
often have sophisticated strategies for tipping the economic bal-
ance of such partnerships in their own favor. In some cases, the
companies and/or intermediaries extend credit to participating
farmers, either in the form of cash or material inputs; and they
later use the farmers’ indebtedness to manipulate the terms of
the agreements. Alternately, some companies structure out-
grower contracts so that the company provides seeds, fertilizer,
and other inputs, with the understanding that these up-front
costs will be deducted from the price the company pays for the
wood at harvest. However, once farmers are ready to harvest,
an unscrupulous company may report these costs at inflated lev-
els, thereby ensuring that the farmers receive an artificially low
price for their wood. Plantation companies can exert considerable
leverage over wood prices when they are able to restrict the spe-
cies that farmers plant and/or when they are the only (or even
the largest) buyer within a commercial distance of the small-
holders’ tree farms.

8. Implications for REDD+

In this article, we have shown how the mediation of reforesta-
tion and forest restoration programs by powerful political eco-
nomic interests have been accompanied by a host of governance
challenges and tradeoffs in countries across the Asia–Pacific region.
In various contexts, they have:

� consolidated the control of state agencies and corporate actors
over ‘degraded’ forest landscapes, often resulting in the margin-
alization or displacement of rural communities;
� exacerbated economic disparities in the forestry sector by chan-

neling large capital subsidies and resource rents to companies
with close ties to state elites;
� facilitated corruption and financial fraud, in some cases on a

grand scale;
� accelerated biodiversity loss by creating perverse incentives for

the conversion of ‘degraded’ secondary forests; and
� generated mixed results for rural small-holders, at times under-

mining livelihood security by locking them in inequitable
agreements with plantation companies, and in other cases,
offering enhanced tenure security over replanted areas.

Collectively, these outcomes pose fundamental challenges for
efforts to enhance carbon stocks through reforestation and forest
