18 C.M. Barr, J.A. Sayer / Biological Conservation 154 (2012) 9–19
Strong safeguards will be needed to avoid negative impacts on the
livelihoods and well-being of smallholders. Effective approaches
will also be needed to anticipate and mitigate conflicts over land
and forest resources before they become violent.

In conclusion, we note that a number of recent initiatives may
provide useful lessons for REDD+ in promoting reforestation and
restoration schemes that offer a broad array of public goods and
also contribute to the livelihoods of local people. The Global Initia-
tive for Forest Landscape Restoration, which is led by the Interna-
tional Union for Conservation of Nature, the United Kingdom
Forestry Commission and the United States Forest Service, has
the goal of building assets for people and nature (IUCN, 2011).
The Global Initiative is based upon principles of multi-stakeholder
decision making for activities that are undertaken at a landscape
scale; and it aspires to achieve a hierarchy of institutional respon-
sibilities from the household and community up to industrial cor-
porations and state forest services. It does, however, place heavy
emphasis on shifting the locus of control from the state to local
stakeholders. The International Tropical Timber Organization’s
Guidelines for the Reforestation, Restoration and Rehabilitation
of Degraded Tropical Forest Lands (ITTO, 2005) also provides a use-
ful framework that can inform efforts to use REDD+ resources to
support reforestation and restoration.
