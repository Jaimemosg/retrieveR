� Sino-Forest, through its subsidiaries, appears to have engaged in
significant non-arm’s length transactions.
� Sino-Forest and certain of its officers and directors appear to

have misrepresented some of its revenue and/or exaggerated
some of its timber holdings by providing information to the
public . . . which may have been false or misleading.
� Sino-Forest and certain of its officers and directors. . . appear to

be engaging or participating in acts, practices or a course of con-
duct related to its securities which it and/or they know or rea-
sonably ought to know perpetuate a fraud (Ontario Securities
Commission, 2011).

Clearly, the Sino Forest case is far from over, and the company
has not yet acknowledged that it or its directors have violated
any laws. However, to the extent the allegations now being made
by the Ontario Securities Commission prove to be true, the case
would appear to be what one industry analyst has called ‘‘a
Madoff moment’’ for commercial tree-planting initiatives in
China.
5. Perverse incentives for forest degradation and conversion

Ironically, government policies ostensibly promoting reforesta-
tion have, in some cases, accelerated biodiversity loss by providing
perverse incentives for unsustainable management and conversion
of natural forests. In the Asia–Pacific region and beyond, Repetto
and Gillis (1988) documented the significant role that weak forest
fiscal systems and timber concession regulations have played in
encouraging deforestation and forest degradation. They noted that
governments’ failure to capture much of the economic rents asso-
ciated with commercial timber extraction have given concession-
holders a strong incentive to undervalue the forest resources which
they were charged with managing sustainably.

In particular, Repetto and Gillis noted that in Indonesia, Malay-
sia, and the Philippines, governments had introduced reforestation
deposits which companies were ostensibly required to pay in order
to guarantee they would carry out enrichment planting and other
rehabilitation activities in logged over concession areas (cf Gillis,
1998a,b; Boado, 1998). However, in each case the government
had set these deposits at levels that were well below the costs that
timber companies would realistically incur if they actually carried
out post-logging restoration. Not surprisingly, most timber compa-
nies viewed the reforestation deposit as an outright tax which they
could pay in order to absolve themselves of government regula-
tions requiring concession-holders to replant the areas they had
harvested.

More generally, state regulations allowing the clearing and
replanting of timber concession areas once they reach a specified
threshold of degradation have provided logging companies with
a strong incentive to over-harvest their concession sites (Meijard
and Sheil, 2007). This has been the case in Indonesia, for example,
where the Ministry of Forestry since the late-1980s has allowed
selective logging concessions on ’degraded’ sites, yet which often
have significant commercial standing stocks remaining, to be
cleared for industrial plantation development. In the absence of
effective law enforcement, forestry companies have routinely ex-
tracted timber from their concession areas well above legal and
sustainable harvest levels; and in many cases, they have been re-
warded for doing so by receiving licenses to clear the remaining
forest cover from their now ‘degraded’ concession sites as part of
the Ministry’s reforestation program (Barr, 2002). For recipients
of financial subsidies from the state’s Reforestation Fund, these
incentives have been compounded substantially.

In spatial planning processes, forestry ministries in some coun-
tries have explicitly designated large areas of ‘degraded’ secondary
forests for conversion to commercial tree plantations. With the sta-
ted aim of promoting reforestation, government policies encourage
the removal of remaining forest stock before these areas are re-
planted. Under such circumstances, reforestation can effectively
catalyze the loss of natural forest cover and the biodiversity it sup-
ports (Brockerhoff et al., 2008).
6. Land conflicts and resistance from upland communities

In many countries across Asia–Pacific, large-scale reforestation
initiatives have catalyzed conflicts between rural communities, on
the one hand, and state forestry agencies and commercial planta-
tion companies, on the other. This is particularly the case in areas
where governments have asserted state control over forest land-
scapes theretofore managed by local communities under custom-
ary tenure systems. Although national forestry laws often
recognize the existence of traditional tenure systems, they gener-
ally define customary rights as being subordinate to statutory
claims over forest resources and stipulate that rights of exclusion
under customary systems are enforceable in only limited circum-
stances (Peluso and Vandergeest, 2001). In most Asia–Pacific
countries, few institutional mechanisms exist to resolve compet-
ing claims and other contradictions between national forestry
laws and customary tenure systems (Vandergeest and Peluso,
2006).

Conflicts between rural communities and state forestry agen-
cies are especially common in ‘degraded’ forest landscapes which
the latter have scheduled for reforestation or conversion to planta-
tions. This is frequently the case, for instance, in areas where the
degradation has resulted from unsustainable harvesting practices
in government-allocated timber concessions. All too often, forestry
departments have drawn land-use maps and defined concession
boundaries without regard to the extent these may overlap with
areas managed by forest-dependent peoples under customary ten-
ure systems (Peluso and Vandergeest, 2001). Not surprisingly, the
extraction of timber by outside logging companies often results
in the disruption of agro-ecosystems and the loss of cultural and
material resources for local communities. As Fried (2000) notes,
however, the resulting displacement of local communities can be
exacerbated significantly when these areas are converted to plan-
tations, as this process generally involves intensive and long-term
industrial use of the entire concession area by the corporate li-
cense-holder.

In other contexts, government forestry departments view up-
land communities as being agents of forest destruction and use na-
tional laws to curtail land-use practices which they perceive as
contributing to degradation of forest lands (Barney, 2008). This is
commonly the case, for instance, in areas where upland communi-
ties use swidden agricultural systems which depend on rotational
clearing of forest plots for subsistence crop production. In Malay-
sia, Indonesia, Laos, and perhaps other parts of the region, state
agencies have actively sought to resettle upland communities
practicing swidden agriculture and to induce them to adopt seden-
tary agricultural production systems. Although governments have
justified such policies as being necessary for ‘development’ and
integration of remote communities with the market economy, they
are also often motivated by a desire to make forest resources avail-
able for timber extraction and conversion to commercial planta-
tions. In many cases, state agencies and plantation companies
have used pressure, intimidation, and at times, physical coercion
to compel upland communities to participate in such resettlement
programs, while offering nominal compensation.

Barney (2007) describes the dynamics of one such resettlement
process carried out by the Sarawak state government and a planta-
tion company in support of the planned Borneo Pulp and Paper
