sustainable raw material supplies for small, medium, and large-
scale forest industries (Sayer and Maginnis, 2005; Sayer et al.,
2004).

In fact, many countries likely to participate in REDD+ have con-
siderable experience with reforestation and forest restoration ini-
tiatives. In the Asia–Pacific region, national governments – often
in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral donor agencies –
have promoted large-scale tree-planting programs for several dec-
ades (Lamb, 2011). These have been designed to achieve a range of
objectives, including:

� sustainable raw material supplies for forest industries;
� poverty alleviation and rural economic development;
� soil conservation;
� stabilization of sloping lands; and
� watershed protection.

Although these programs have often involved substantial
investments of both capital and technical assistance, recent assess-
ments suggest that they have achieved very uneven results and
many have failed to meet planting targets and other measurable
indicators of success (Lamb, 2011). In most cases, weak forest gov-
ernance has been an underlying constraint.

In this article, we examine the political and economic factors
that have commonly shaped reforestation and forest restoration
initiatives in the Asia–Pacific region. We draw on case materials
from the substantial literature on tree-planting schemes in Indone-
sia, Malaysia, Laos, Vietnam, India, and China. We argue that both
in design and implementation, reforestation programs have often
been guided, on the one hand, by forest rent distribution practices
of state forestry bureaucracies; and on the other hand, by the accu-
mulation strategies of corporate actors involved in increasingly
globalized commodity chains. The convergence of these interests
has meant that reforestation and restoration initiatives have fre-
quently exacerbated existing inequities in the forestry sector by
further concentrating resources in the hands of powerful political
and economic actors, often to the detriment of forest-dependent
communities.

We want to emphasize at the outset that our purpose in exam-
ining the political economy of reforestation and forest restoration
is not to deny the many potential benefits of such initiatives.
Rather, our aim is to highlight a set of risk factors that proponents
of REDD+ will need to anticipate and address if efforts to promote
the enhancement of carbon stocks through large-scale tree-plant-
ing and forest regeneration programs are to achieve their objec-
tives in a truly equitable and sustainable manner. We view the
potential for REDD+ to facilitate investments in forestry assets to
be of considerable value, but only if the governance problems that
have led to poor performance of past efforts can be addressed
effectively.

2. Consolidating state control over ‘degraded’ forest landscapes

Across the Asia–Pacific region, many countries have a history of
state control over forest resources that dates from the colonial era.
As Peluso and Vandergeest (2001) have described, ‘‘the idea of
state territorial sovereignty over a category of land called ‘forests’
emerged in Southeast Asia in the nineteenth century,’’ and the cre-
ation of ‘‘political forests’’ became a common project among the re-
gion’s colonial-era states and post-colonial national governments.
Since then, governments have used a variety of strategies to assert
control over forested landscapes and the resources they contained,
including ‘‘territorial zoning and mapping, the enactment of land
and forest laws delimiting legal and illegal forest uses, the consti-
tution of state forestry institutions to implement these laws
according to specified procedures, the constitution of forest police,
and the creation of legal exemptions that became customary
rights’’ (Peluso and Vandergeest, 2001; Peluso, 1992). Through
such practices, ‘‘’forest land’ became that land that was either
demarcated by the state for permanent reservation or that land
that was claimed by the state’’ (Peluso and Vandergeest, 2001).

As a result, many contemporary state forestry bureaucracies
hold administrative authority over vast areas which have been des-
ignated as ‘forest estate’. In Indonesia, for instance, the Ministry of
Forestry is charged with administering a ‘forest estate’ of 132 mil-
lion ha – amounting to approximately 70% of the nation’s total land
area – of which some 110 million ha are classified as ‘permanent
forest’ (Direktorat Jenderal Planologi, 2010). Significantly, the Min-
istry reports that at least 28 million ha of the total area designated
as ‘permanent forest’ are not currently under forest cover (Direkto-
rat Jenderal Planologi, 2010).

As sociologist James Scott points out, such categories may sim-
ply reflect the limits of what the state is able to see (Scott, 1998); in
fact, at least a portion of these ‘non-forested’ areas are known to be
covered by agroforestry systems actively managed by local com-
munities (Fay and Sirait, 2004; Contreras-Hermosilla and Fay,
2005). This underscores the extent to which the ‘political forest’
is a construction that does not correspond neatly to ecological def-
initions. As Peluso and Vandergeest (2001) note, this has been the
case since state-controlled forests were originally demarcated:
‘‘Not all forest cover was included in the area allocated for state
forestry, nor was all state forest land actually forested.’’

Just as the notion of the forest estate is politically constructed,
so too is the concept of ‘degraded forest’. Indeed, the definition
of what constitutes ‘degraded’ forestland is variable and arbitrary,
and even a specific institution’s usage of the term can change over
time. Barney (2008) examines, for example, the contradictory def-
initions that have been deployed in Laos PDR:

There are various definitions for ‘degraded forest’ in Laos, and
there is also little clarity in actual implementation. The Ministry
of Agriculture and Forestry uses an area of less than thirty cubic
meters of standing timber to define ‘degraded forest’. For the
1994–2003 ADB Industrial Tree Plantation Project, degraded for-
ests were defined as forestland with less than 20 percent crown
cover. The World Bank, following standard sampling measures,
uses a timber volume of less than seventy to eighty cubic meters
for determining degraded ‘production forest’. . . As with other
countries in the region, the concept of degraded forests in Laos
is associated with a significant obscurity: Is it based on a set of
scientific criteria measuring characteristics of the vegetation,
or on whether degraded forests are simply those forests declared
and legally classified as such? (Barney, 2008).
Significantly, the act of defining an area of forestland as ‘de-
graded’ is fundamentally a political act which shapes decisions
regarding land-use and access. In many contexts, the designation
of an area as ‘degraded forest’ (or variations of the term, such as
‘wasteland’ or ‘barren land’) is often a prelude to the clearing and
replanting of that space under the mantle of reforestation or forest
restoration. As Barney (2008) poignantly notes: ‘‘Identifying forest-
land territories as degraded forest is useful for the political project
of evacuating these zones of substantive social, economic, or eco-
logical significance’’.

In countries where governments exercise control over a na-
tional forest estate, forestry bureaucracies routinely face questions
of legitimacy over their continued administration of ‘degraded’ for-
est landscapes, especially when these areas have little or no (high-
value) tree cover. This is often the case, for instance, in commercial
concession sites following heavy timber extraction and in national
parks following encroachment by illegal loggers or agricultural set-
tlers. At the policy level, competing ministries often lobby to have
