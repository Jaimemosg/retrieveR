6   Tracking Progress in Land Policy  
Development and Implementation

6.1 The Development of Tracking Systems

6.1.1 The scope and value of tracking

Effective tracking of land policy development and implementation is a complex 
though important process for African governments and their development 
partners. Its major objective is to enable governments perform a number 
of functions, namely (i) make timely re-adjustments to policy processes; (ii) 
take  appropriate measures to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of land 
policies; (iii) learn from past successes and failures; (iv) disseminate local good 
practices for use at the national level; (v) improve the quality of knowledge 
and building capacities for further monitoring and evaluation; (vi) secure 
and consolidate the participation and commitment of all stakeholders and 
development partners; and (vii) enable governments to manage emerging 
issues and other incidental developments in the land sector in an organic and 
systematic way. The regional consultations conducted during the process of 
developing this Framework and Guidelines, suggest that to date there have 
been few significant national experiences on the continent, with respect to 
the efficient and systematic tracking of progress in land policy development 
and implementation. 

6.1.2 Designing systems/mechanisms for tracking

Nonetheless there are, in Africa, tracking mechanisms in other fields which can 
be supportive of land policy development and implementation. For instance, 
there are land observatories in existence in a number of African countries 
including Chad which can be adapted to this purpose. Other methods include 
the use of objective tools or indicators to track the performance of various 
components of the land sector. In addition, a number of agencies including 
UNEP, UN-Habitat and the Norwegian Survey and Mapping Organization, have
