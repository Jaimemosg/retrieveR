5   Land Policy  
Implementation

5.1 The Challenge of Land Policy Implementation

Although many African countries have utilized a variety of strategies, in 
developing new or revising existing national land policies in response to 
perceived problems in their land and related sectors, the rate of implementation 
of these policies has been slow and in some cases disappointing. In East 
and Southern Africa where most countries have completed the land policy 
development stage, devising the legislation required for the implementation 
of major aspects of the policy has taken as much as five years or more. More 
often than not, countries have spent a considerable amount of resources 
in the development of action plans than on the actual execution of policy 
prescriptions. A preliminary examination of some of the more common 
impediments to land policy implementation is therefore necessary if rapid 
progress is to be made. 

5.2 Some Common Impediments to Land Policy 
Implementation

5.2.1	Failure	to	agree	on	implementation	strategies

The first impediment is that implementation strategies and modalities are 
seldom considered as important elements which require as much debate 
and consensus building as the substantive problems targeted in policy 
development. A cursory examination of the documents embodying completed 
land policies shows that, in most cases, implementation modalities do not 
form part of drafts submitted for public debate or stakeholder consultations 
nor do they form part of drafts submitted for cabinet and parliamentary 
endorsement. Rather, implementation modalities are usually addressed in in-
house operational guidelines prepared after the policy development process
