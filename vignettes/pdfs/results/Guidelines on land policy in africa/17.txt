Executive Summary

In 2006, the AUC, the UNECA and the AfDB initiated a process for the development 
of a framework and guidelines for land policy and land reform in Africa with a view 
to strengthening land rights, enhancing productivity and securing livelihoods for the 
majority of the continent’s population. That initiative was carried out by way of extensive 
consultations involving the participation of RECs in all the five regions of the continent, 
civil society organizations, centres of excellence in Africa and elsewhere, practitioners 
and researchers in land policy development and implementation, government agencies 
and Africa’s development partners. The final outcome of the initiative was then presented 
before the formal decision-making processes of the AU for approval and adoption by 
the Assembly of Heads of State and Government in July 2009.

The Framework and Guidelines (F&G) which follow are presented in seven interrelated 
chapters. Chapter One provides the justification for and process followed in developing 
the F&G. Chapter Two describes the context which has defined the nature and 
characteristics of the land question in Africa in order to explain the reason why the land 
sector has not played its primary role in the development process. That role is examined 
in Chapter Three. Chapter Four sets out the key operational processes which African 
countries will need to follow in order to develop comprehensive policies that would 
enable the land sector to fully perform that role. Chapter Five analyses the difficulties 
likely to be met and conditions necessary for the effective implementation of such 
policies. Chapter Six discusses the measures which African countries may wish to put in 
place to track progress in the development and implementation of those policies. The 
final chapter is a concluding statement on how member countries of the AU might want 
to use the F&G.
