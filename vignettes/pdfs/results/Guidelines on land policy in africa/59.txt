7   Overall Conclusion

Sustainable growth and development in Africa as well the continent’s 
contribution to the world economy in the 21st century will continue to depend 
largely on the manner in which land and land-related resources are secured, 
used and managed.  This will require that these issues be addressed through 
comprehensive people-driven land policies and reforms which confer full 
political, social, economic and environmental benefits to the majority of the 
African people. Although considerable progress in this direction is already 
being made throughout Africa, a great deal more still needs to be done. This 
calls for both commitment from individual member states and co-operation 
at the regional and continental levels.

The Framework and Guidelines set out in this document seeks to provide a 
set of iterative processes which urge that countries should first identify the 
contextual challenges facing their specific national land and associated sectors 
and economies before policies and programmes of reform can be developed 
and implemented. Central to those processes is the need for a fully gendered, 
informed and participatory mobilization and continuous engagement of all 
stakeholders in the land and related sectors at all stages of policy development, 
implementation and review. An important dividend, the Framework and 
Guidelines argue, is not simply the sustainable stewardship and utilization of 
Africa’s primary development resource, but the deepening and consolidation 
of peace, security and democracy. The African Union expects that member 
countries which are in the course of or are contemplating the initiation, 
review, revision or comprehensive development and implementation of all or 
part of policies designed to ensure that their land systems are fully integrated 
into national development processes, will find them a useful guide.
