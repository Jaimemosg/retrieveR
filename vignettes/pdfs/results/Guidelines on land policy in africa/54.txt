5.4 Assessing the Impact of 
Land Policy Implementation 
Processes

Once the steps outlined in this Chapter are 
taken, there will always be need to monitor 
and evaluate the impacts of the various 
components of land policy. This will require 
the establishment and institutionalization of 
mechanisms that will enable policy-makers and 
all stakeholders in the land sector to assess and 
deal with any such issues including those arising 
from processes which precede land policy 
implementation. The next chapter provides a 
set of guidelines which African countries may 
wish to use for these purposes.
