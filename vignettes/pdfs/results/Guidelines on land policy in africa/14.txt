The Framework and Guidelines has been developed through a broad consultative and 
inclusive process and is based on rigorous analysis and assessment of factual situations 
and realities. It was endorsed by the Joint Conference of Ministers of Agriculture, Land 
and Livestock held in April 2009 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, while the 13th Ordinary 
Session of the African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government held in July 
2009, Sirte, Libya, adopted the “Declaration on Land Issues and Challenges in Africa” 
urging the effective implementation of the Framework and Guidelines on Land Policy in 
Africa. The Assembly further requested the African Union Commission, in collaboration 
with ECA, AfDB and the Regional Economic Communities to support Member States in 
their efforts towards reviewing, developing and implementing land policies including 
mechanisms for progress tracking and reporting.

The AUC-ECA-AfDB Consortium has engaged with key development partners in seeking 
support at regional and national levels for this work and wishes to express gratitude for 
their support at the different stages of the process and for helping to move the agenda 
forward. We strongly hope that this exemplary engagement will continue during the 
implementation phase to achieve successful results.

A viable Land Policy is a sine qua non for Africa’s realisation of its   development agenda. 
We, therefore, strongly recommend this Framework and Guidelines to all stakeholders 
including policy and decision makers, practitioners, and Civil Society Organisations, as 
an integral toolkit and reference for developing efficient national and regional land 
policies and programmes.
