existing legal and institutional structures 
governing other aspects of the land system. 
One unfortunate result of this otherwise 
laudable response to environmental concerns 
has been significant fragmentation and 
duplication of authority and responsibilities in 
land governance that has led to serious conflict 
and competition not only across line ministries 
and institutions but also between central and 
local government authorities. It is important 
therefore that if institutions responsible for land 
governance, including land held by the state, 
are to operate in a transparent, accountable, 
and efficient manner, that they be harmonized 
and their respective mandates rationalized. 
Further, experience has shown that where 
such institutions are decentralized, thus 
facilitating the devolution of decision-making 
power and authority to local communities 
and other stakeholders, land resources are 
likely to be more productively used and 
preserved. Addressing these issues will require 

considerable will and commitment from policy-
makers and practitioners.

3.7 Implications for Land Policy 
Development

There is no doubt that land in Africa is a 
fundamental social and cultural asset as well 
as a critically important development resource, 
especially for the poor, in both rural and urban 
situations. The realization of those values will 
require effective land policy development which 
balances the rights and interests of all users, and 
ensure the inclusion of all members of society 
especially women, persons with disability and 
other landless poor, to enable them realize full 
social, environmental and economic benefits 
from land, and which in addition enhances 
political stability and democratic institution 
building.
