In addition, the overall condition of the 
environment depends to a large extent on 
how land resources are used and managed. 
Consequently land policy development 
must provide anchorage for further policy 
development for these related sectors and sub-
sectors. Conversely it is important that existing 
laws, plans and management systems in these 
other sectors and sub-sectors are appropriately 
revised to ensure that they do not impede the 
implementation of the reforms contemplated 
in new land policies.
