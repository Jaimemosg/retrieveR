2   The Context of the  
Land Question

2.1 Conceptualising the Land Question

The land question facing Africa has its origins in geo-political, economic, 
social and demographic factors more recently compounded by emerging 
global and strategic imperatives. These include different forms and modes 
of colonization experienced in various regions, the diversity and degree 
of persistence of indigenous cultural and normative systems and forms of 
economic organizations. These factors and imperatives have, in turn, given 
rise to a variety of legal regimes relating to land tenure, use, management 
and environmental governance. 

In addition, contemporary processes of social organization and mobilization 
including those derived from class, gender, region, culture, ethnicity, 
nationality and generational cleavages now predominate in shaping access 
to, control and utilization of land, resulting in a complex basis of claims 
and conflicts over land resources. While these diverse contexts have led to 
variations in national approaches to land policy and land reforms, it is also 
the case that some commonalities and challenges have emerged leading to 
similar responses in the design of new land rights regimes. 

2.2 The Geographical and Ecological Context

One of the key aspects of Africa’s land question is that in spite of extensive 
dependence on farming, not much of the continent’s land is arable or 
potentially arable.  Large parts of the continent are deserts or semi-arid, 
and/or facing ecological damage.  In many instances, unequal distribution 
of land has relegated a growing population of small farmers onto marginal 
areas leading to increasing physiological pressure and land and resource 
degradation including deforestation. In many parts of the continent, erosive 
downpours accompanied by flooding and intermittent droughts have also 
tended to accelerate soil exhaustion and land cover losses. This remains
