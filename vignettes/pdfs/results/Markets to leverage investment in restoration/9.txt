might provide substantial benefits for biodiversity conservation
(Strassburg et al., 2012), some key biodiversity conservation areas that
are relatively carbon poorer might be severely disadvantaged by in-
vestments based solely on carbon (Strassburg et al., 2010). Perversely,
therefore, in many locations and situations, a profit-driven market
could work to prevent more environmentally beneficial kinds of re-
storation. For instance, there is limited market appetite for more ex-
pensive carbon that offers biodiversity or other co-benefits. More often,
the voluntary carbon market and non-market public sector payment-
for-performance agreements offer low prices – in 2014, voluntary
market prices were $5.4 per tCO2, and Norway and Germany used a
proxy price of $5 per tCO2 in non-market payments to Brazil's Amazon
Fund and Guyana (Goldstein, 2015) – which automatically restricts the
locations where the market can operate.

5.4. Can we obtain market-based restoration at landscape scales?

Many ecosystem service or timber enterprises require economies of
scale to become profitable (and enhance profitability). Similarly, to be
of most ecological value, larger-scale restoration will reduce edge and
isolation fragmentation effects, improving the potential for biodiversity
recolonization and persistence. Persuading multiple landholders within
a landscape to achieve sufficient restoration to generate economies of
scale and ecological sustainability and resilience is a major challenge.
In part, this challenge could depend upon the relationship between
international or national and more local markets. The former is likely to
target bigger-scale planning, whereas the latter is likely to be smaller
scale and more isolated. But if international- or national-mediated in-
vestment ignores the needs of local people, then this could undermine
project longevity and even been seen as neo-colonialism.

5.5. How to balance markets for goods versus markets for ecosystem
services?

Given the diversity of options of EGS, a core challenge is to better
understand the synergies and tradeoffs between these options in terms
of their ecological and financial returns. For example, might the market
for plantation-grown pulpwood be more attractive than the market(s)
for diverse ecosystem services? Such an understanding can inform
landscape planning to identify the locations in which one (or a package
of) markets will maximize benefits and profitability and where the
operation of a free market may have to be constrained (e.g. to protect
watersheds or biodiversity). While we suggested above that large-scale
restoration projects will likely yield higher benefits, social concerns
may require landscape partitioning to harness both kinds of markets.
The question therefore is finding the best scale for mixing to meet social
requirements while preventing the breakdown of economies of scale
and landscape connectivity. One potential is to use market manipula-
tion, via subsidies, cheap finance, or legal and policy frameworks, to
promote socially and ecologically balanced restoration that is attractive
to market investors.

6. A way forward – how to harness power of markets to accelerate
restoration?

It seems that markets can sometimes drive reforestation of defor-
ested and degraded landscapes and that once the process is initiated
then further market opportunities can arise (e.g. businesses involving
seed collection, seedling production, plantation management con-
tracting, harvesting of forest products etc.) that may drive the process
further. But market situations reflect two distinct modalities. In one, the
market signals are not strong enough to initiate changes in current land
use or farming practices. In such cases, governments or NGOs are
needed to complement existing market forces and reduce perceived
risks by building the capacity of landholders to engage in reforestation
and advising them on how to increase benefits including financial

returns. The other situation is when the market signal is, instead, so
strong that it overwhelms all other land use activities and leads to a
transformed and homogenized landscape. This has occurred with
agricultural crops such as wheat or oil palm, but also with tree plan-
tations such as rubber or pulpwood (e.g. Acacia mangium across parts of
Southeast Asia).

In the first case, traditional extension activities and knowledge-
sharing could eventually be enough to generate changes in attitudes
and encourage reforestation, although financial incentives may also be
needed, at least initially, to overcome perceived opportunity costs. In
the second case, the power of the market may need to be redirected or
curtailed in some way. This might be achieved by land-use planning
that seeks to diversify the types of reforestation undertaken (e.g. greater
emphasis on native species or mixed-species plantations) or that em-
phasizes reforestation of certain types of land (highly degraded areas,
steep slopes, riparian areas). These latter strategies may be easier if the
power of the market for forest products can be complemented by a
market for ecosystem services. In each case, history suggests govern-
ments have a critical role to play in establishing appropriate policy
settings and institutional arrangements.
