Table 1
Typical reforestation types included in Forest and Landscape Restoration and their appropriateness for specific stakeholder group and market
motivations (Edwards and Laurance 2012; Gray et al., 2014; Giam et al., 2015; Nepstad et al., 2014; Waern, 2015; Bruel et al., 2010; Esquivel-Rios
et al., 2014; Russo, 2009; Richards et al., 2015; Ceccon and Miranda, 2012; Darlington, 1998).

Large-scale ecological restoration programs implemented in the Atlantic
Forest of Brazil by pulpwood companies to comply with the national Forest
Code and obtain certification for exporting their products  

Round-table for Sustainable Palm Oil certification in Dipterocarp forests of
Malaysia and Indonesia, which has been used to improve access to major
purchasers in lucrative western markets. 2.8 million hectares of plantations
were already certified under this scheme in 2016, which requires restoration
of riparian buffers along river edges (Edwards et al. 2011; Gray et al. 2014;
Giam et al. 2015)     

Examples include the soybean roundtable in Brazil, zero deforestation oil
palm in Southeast Asia, and financial mechanisms for the mining sector in
Equator and Africa (Nepstad et al. 2014)  

Restoration of the Yayasan Sabah state forest in Borneo, Malaysia,
supported by IKEA. This project started in 1998 and 12,400 ha of degraded
forests have been restored by 2014, via management of hyperabundant
climbers and pioneer trees, and enrichment planting with >1.7 million tree
saplings of native late successional species.  US$750,000/year have been
invested in seedling nurseries and labour (Waern 2015)     

Production of rubber, palm oil, pulpwood and timber in commercial
plantations established across all tropical regions in lands already converted
to agricultural land uses in the past. Although monoculture tree plantations
causing deforestation and socio-ecological problems should not be
considered a FLR approach, some forestry operations may help to achieve
FLR objectives in forest landscapes already deteriorated by agriculture and
cattle ranching, especially when production stands are spatially planned to
create mosaic landscape

Carbon sequestration project financed by the American Electric Power
Corporation, Chevron and General Motors (US$18.4 million of investment)
to compensate their emissions of greenhouse gases. This program supported
the creation of a 19,000 ha of forest reserves in the Atlantic Forest of
Brazil, in which 1,500 ha of degraded lands were restored (US$2,500/ha of
investment) (Bruel et al. 2010, Ferreti and Britez, 2006)     

Ecotourism project in temperate forests of Mexico to conserve and restore
monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) habitat in the Biosphere reserve,
created to protect this species. Restoration projects started in 1986 and
covered 56,259 ha, and were implemented in partnership with local
populations, which received payments for ecotourism and restoration
activities (Esquivel-Rios et al. 2014).

In  2009, Guayakí became the first Fair Trade Certified yerba mate
company in the world. Guayaki has built relationships with growers of
yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) that are committed to sustainable forest
production. Guayaki's partners sustainably harvest organic yerba mate from
rainforest grown cultivations and reforestation projects, generating a
renewable income stream, which enables local communities to improve
their lives and restore their lands.  Their forest restoration projects are
primarily based in the yerba mate native growing regions of the Atlantic
Forest biome in Argentina, Paraguay and Southern Brazil.       

Establishment of 22 ecological corridors by 240 hectares of restoration
plantations to reconnnect isolated populations of the golden lion tamarin
(Leontopithecus rosalia), one of the most threatened primates of the world,
in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Russo et al. 2009).   

PES program focused on watershed services in the Brazilian Atlantic
Forest, which was based on the restoration of native forests in riparian
buffers to improve hydrological processes in a region that supports drinking
water supply to 10 million people in the metropolitan regions of São Paulo.
The government of the city of Extrema, in partnership with NGOs, private
companies and research institutions, have transferred funds to farmers to
overcome land opportunity costs and provide seedlings, materials, technical
assistance and field labor to implement restoration  (Richards et al. 2015).        

Establishment of local associations to foster the development of small
Eucalyptus woodlots (~1ha) in smallholdings to be used as fuelwood. This
program was financed by fees charged from small fuelwood consumers of
the region and resulted in the implementation of 55,000 ha of woodlots
(Ceccon et al. 2012).      

The promotion of educational programs and conservation/restoration
activities by the preaching of "ecology monks" in Thailand. Modifications
in traditional ceremonies were made to raise funds for local development
projects, including donation of seedlings, which are given to villagers to
reforest degraded areas (Darlington 1998)
