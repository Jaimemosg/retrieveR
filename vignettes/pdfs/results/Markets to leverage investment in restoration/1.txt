Governments and international organizations are promoting or drafting programs to undertake Forest and
Landscape Restoration (FLR) of hundreds of millions of hectares of degraded tropical landscapes to support the
provision of ecosystem goods and services. But the challenge to recover economic and ecological functionality
could be far beyond their financial capacity. Here, we explore the potential of markets and their interaction with
policies to leverage investment for FLR in the tropics. We first review the challenges and opportunities of ex-
ploiting market forces for FLR, which can be essential for kick-starting the implementation of programs globally.
We identify four key opportunities for regulating markets to promote FLR: economic mechanisms; technological,
educational or infrastructural investment; legal and enforcement mechanisms; and market-led standards and
certification schemes. Finally, we present five pitfalls that may arise when relying on markets to promote FLR.
Governments will need to play a critical role in establishing appropriate policy frameworks and institutional
arrangements to leverage investments when market signals are not strong enough to initiate changes in tradi-
tional land use or farming practices, or to regulate reforestation activities when market signals become so strong
that they overwhelm all other land-use activities, leading to a transformed and homogenized landscape.

1. The scale of restoration potential in the tropics

The extent of degraded land around the world poses a growing
concern. Although degradation is used to describe a range of contexts
(Ghazoul et al., 2015; Gibbs and Salmon, 2015; Hobbs, 2016), wide
consensus holds that anthropogenic impacts have remarkably changed
Earth's natural processes and compromised the capacity of ecosystems
to supply benefits to humanity (Lewis et al., 2015). The short-term
profits of unsustainable exploitation of natural resources are largely
uncompensated by the negative economic consequences of longer-term
restrictions on the capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services
to people (Costanza et al., 1997; Balmford et al., 2002). Reducing
perverse incentives for degrading activities and instead promoting
those that support ecosystem recovery are thus key issues to be ad-
dressed by the global economy to provide a better future to all

(Hoekstra and Wiedmann, 2014; Diaz et al., 2015; Newbold et al.,
2016).

Throughout human history, population densities have normally
been sufficiently low to ensure that environmental resources are
available and accessible to people, and that the future provision of
natural benefits was safeguarded. However, the large expansion of in-
tensive agriculture, urbanization, and global population in the 20th
century means that ecosystem goods and services (EGS) are no longer
freely available for a large share of humans. Harvesting forest products
from natural ecosystems is no longer an option for supplying the high
and still growing demand. Land scarcity and concentration of popula-
tion in large urban centers mean that migration is unable to improve
access to EGS essential for human wellbeing. Today, large regions of the
globe face water security risks (Vorosmarty et al., 2010), are threatened
by climate change (Heltberg et al., 2009), and/or have agricultural
