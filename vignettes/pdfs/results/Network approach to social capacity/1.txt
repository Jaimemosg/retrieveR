We  analyzed  the  social  network  structure  for  ecoregion-scale  planning.
Despite  shared  concern  about  wildfire,  organizations  comprised  distinct  networks.
Organizations  with  different  goals  and  geographic  foci  comprised  distinct  networks.
Social  network  ties  among  organizations  were  stronger  at  the  sub-ecoregion  scale.
Network  analysis  can  quantify  social  capacity  for  landscape  planning.

Management  of  ecological  conditions  and  processes  in  multiownership  landscapes  requires  cooperation
by  diverse  stakeholder  groups.  The  structure  of  organizational  networks  –  the  extent  to which  networks
allow  for  interaction  among  organizations  within  and  across  ideological  and  geographic  boundaries  –
can indicate  potential  opportunities  for cooperation  on  landscape-scale  problems.  In  the  arid  landscapes
of  the  western  United  States,  where  increasingly  large  wildfires  burn  irrespective  of  property  boundaries
and  land  designations,  organizations  involved  in  the  restoration  of  forests  and  the protection  of property
from  wildfire  could  benefit  from  working  together  to share  information  and  coordinate  strategies.  We
investigated  patterns  of  interaction  among  organizations  concerned  with  increasingly  uncharacteristic
wildfire  risk  in  the Eastern  Cascades  Ecoregion  of  Oregon  for  evidence  of  structural  conditions  that  create
opportunity  for  cooperation.  Through  social  network  analysis  of interview  data,  we  found  that  despite
sharing  concern  about  wildfire  risk  in an  area  with  a  common  set  of  ecological  conditions,  organizations
with  forest  restoration  and  fire  protection  goals  comprised  distinct  networks,  as  did  organizations  that

focused  on  different  geographic  areas  of  the  ecoregion.  When  interpreted  through  the  lens  of social  capital
and  organizational  theory  these  findings  raise  questions  about  the  extent  to  which  the  structure  of  the
organizational  network  reflects  capacity  to address  wildfire  risk  in fire-prone  forests  on  the ecoregion-
scale.  This  study  provides  insights  on the  utility  of  a structural  approach  for  investigating  social  capacity
for  landscape-scale  planning.

1. Introduction

The need to plan natural resources management at the land-
scape scale is well-recognized because many environmental

processes occur across large areas (Knight & Landres, 1998). The
probability and potential severity of a wildfire, for example, is a
function of the composition and distribution of flammable vegeta-
tion sometimes quite distant from the location of a forested stand
