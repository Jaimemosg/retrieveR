A.P. Fischer et al. / Landscape an

Ager, Vaillant, Finney, & Preisler, 2012). In many cases, however,
lanning at landscape scales is difficult because administrative
oundaries established by society do not conform to ecological
oundaries (Landres, Knight, Pickett, & Cadenasso, 1998). This is
specially true with large landscapes such as ecoregions, which are
omposed of many public and private land ownerships (Powell,
010). Around the world, organizations, agencies, and academic
cholars seek to increase understanding of cooperation across
wnerships on natural resource management to improve natural
esource management (Brunckhorst, 2011).

In lieu of agencies or organizations equipped to manage multi-
wnership landscapes, organizational networks can potentially
lay an important role in natural resource planning on large spatial
cales. Organizational networks are defined as sets of interacting
rganizations and the ties among them. Ties refer to relationships
nd interactions between organizations, such as for the purpose of
orking together or sharing information. Organizational networks

enerally form when capabilities of existing organizations are
nsufficient to complete a given task on their own, and costs pro-
ibit adding to those capabilities internally, and when there are

unctional gains associated with connecting to others (Benjamin,
rechin, & Thoms, 2011; Wolf, 2011). Organizational networks can
erve as collaborative institutional structures uniting stakeholders
nto both formal and informal arrangements that can help facilitate
ows of information and resources, and fulfill functions necessary

or dealing with cross-boundary issues that traditional ownership-
ocused organizations cannot. Because networks are not bound
o a specific structure, they can operate across multiple jurisdic-
ions and geographies (multiscalar), have many centers of authority
polycentric), and consist of local to national stakeholders and
rganizations (multi-level) (Powell, 2010). This flexible structure
llows networks to address large-scale, multi-jurisdictional prob-
ems beyond a single organization’s capacity (Butler & Goldstein,
010).

By bringing organizations with different goals, geographic
oci and land management preferences into contact with each
ther, networks can help create conditions for cooperation across
wnership boundaries on landscape planning. Cross-boundary
ooperation refers to communication, coordination and joint-
mplementation by multiple parties of plans and actions on scales
arger than single ownerships (Yaffee, 1998). The theory of coop-
ration is based on the benefits of reciprocity to participating
arties when combined efforts can achieve more than individual
fforts. For cooperation to be possible, several social conditions
ust be met: parties must share a common understanding of a

roblem (shared cognition) and sense of belonging to a common
roup (shared identity), and view other parties as fair, capable and
ntitled to play a role (perceived legitimacy) (Bouas & Komorita,
996; Gass, Rickenbach, Schulte, & Zeuli, 2009; Rickenbach & Reed,
002; Swaab, Postmes, van Beest, & Spears, 2007; Tyler, 2006; Tyler

 Degoey, 1995). Opportunities for exchanging information and
deas, such as through formal and informal networks, are impor-
ant for building social conditions that foster cooperation among
iverse stakeholders (Ostrom, 1990; Yaffee, 1998). However, the
atural social tendency to interact with others who are geograph-

cally or socially near (i.e., homophily) (McPherson, Smith-Lovin,
 Cook, 2001) conceivably could impede social cohesion among
iverse stakeholders across large areas. Little is known about the
xtent to which shared concern about natural resource problems
an counter this tendency.

Given the potential role networks can play in landscape plan-
ing, and the fact that increasingly large and intense wildfires

re a pressing challenge in many countries (Williams, 2013), we
nvestigated a network of organizations concerned about wild-
re risk for evidence of social ties that promote cooperation on

andscape-scale planning. Our goal was to investigate whether
an Planning 147 (2016) 18–27 19

shared concern about landscape-scale problems could counter
homophily as an influence on the structure of an organizational
network. Our research questions were: (1) To what extent are orga-
nizations with different management goals and geographic foci
interacting with each other around the problem of wildfire risk,
and (2) What do these patterns of interaction suggest about oppor-
tunities for cooperation on landscape planning?

We  hypothesized that organizations concerned with wildfire
risk would interact more with organizations that shared the same
goals and geographic focus than with organizations that did not.
According to social capital and social network theories, this ten-
dency would suggest that while subnetworks of like-organizations
may  be in a position to communicate about, coordinate, and jointly-
implement plans, the network as a whole would not exhibit a
structure that promotes cooperation.

Our geographic focus was the Eastern Cascades Ecoregion (ECE)
in Oregon, USA (Omernik, 1987) (Fig. 1), where wildfires are becom-
ing increasingly large and difficult to control. Ecoregions are large
landscapes with distinct assemblages of natural communities that
share species dynamics and environmental conditions. Coopera-
tion on planning at the ecoregion scale can be helpful because it can
facilitate management of a common problem in a common set of
environmental conditions (Powell, 2010). For example, in the case
of wildfire, cooperative planning could facilitate agreement on cir-
cumstances under which management techniques such as thinning
and prescribed burning are appropriate for reducing flammable
vegetation and restoring forest conditions to lessen the risk of large
wildfires, and strategic use of these techniques.

Social network analysis (Wasserman & Faust, 1994) served as
the basis of our methodological approach. Social network analy-
sis assumes that the structure of networks – the extent to which
networks allow for interaction among organizations within and
across social and geographic boundaries – can indicate potential
to build the mutual understanding, group identity, and perceived
legitimacy needed for cooperation on landscape planning. Network
analysis has been used in sociology and organizational studies to
quantify structural conditions for cooperation (Borgatti, Jones, &
Everett, 1998; Burt, 2000; Lin, 1999), including in natural resource
management contexts (Bodin & Crona, 2009; Bodin, Crona, &
Ernstson, 2006; Newig, Günther, & Pahl-Wostl, 2010). In ecology,
studies have used network analysis to understand ecological struc-
tures and processes for landscape planning purposes (Cook, 2002;
Cumming, Bodin, Ernstson, & Elmqvist, 2010; Jongman, Külvik, &
Kristiansen, 2004; Kong, Yin, Nakagoshi, & Zong, 2010; Minor &
Urban, 2008; Rhodes, Wardell-Johnson, Rhodes, & Raymond, 2006;
Saura & Pascual-Hortal, 2007). Some scholars have proposed social
network analysis as a useful approach to examining social capac-
ity for planning and management at landscape scales (Bodin &
Tengö, 2012; Cumming et al., 2010; Guerrero, McAllister, Corcoran,
& Wilson, 2013; Mills et al., 2014; Opdam, Steingröver, & Rooij,
2006), although empirical studies are limited.

We  interpreted our findings about network structure through
the lens of social capital and social network theory to identify
opportunities for cooperation on landscape planning. These the-
ories suggest that bonding social capital structure (i.e., interactions
among actors in the same social group) promotes communication
and collective action (Borgatti et al., 1998), transfer of knowledge
(Reagans & McEvily, 2003), creation of common norms, and devel-
opment of trust and mutual understanding (Burt, 2000; Coleman,
1990). Bridging social capital structure (i.e., interaction between
actors from different groups), on the other hand, promotes access
to new information and resources needed for complex problem-

solving (Burt, 2000; Granovetter, 1973; Lin, 1999; Reagans &
McEvily, 2003; Reagans & Zuckerman, 2001; Rogers, 1983; Ruef,
2002). We  investigate the extent to which the network of orga-
nizations concerned with wildfire risk in the ECE exhibit a balance
