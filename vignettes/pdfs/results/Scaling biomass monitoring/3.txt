mangroves. The bulk of the harvest data originates from the Gazi
Bay area (4�250S, 39�300E) located �55 km south of the city of
Mombasa in Kenya (Fig. 1) and was made available through collab-
oration with Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute
(KMFRI). The Gazi Bay data has been divided into two sub-sites;
Gazi (the area next to Gazi village) and Kinondo (the area next to
Kinondo village). An additional study within the Gazi Bay area by
Slim et al. (1996) was considered for inclusion but discounted as
it was not possible to obtain the raw data. Attempts were made
to source additional datasets from outwith Africa in order to ex-
pand the range of stem diameter and height data available for each
species and also to provide some data for species (e.g. Xylocarpus
sp.) not included in any of the African studies. An extensive litera-
ture search was carried out to look for raw harvest data which
were (1) from the same species that occur in Kenya and (2) freely
available in the publication. It was only possible to find one study
which met both these criteria; that of Poungparn et al. (2002) from
South-East Asia.

The harvest dataset used in this study to develop regression
models comprises the raw data from 337 individually harvested
trees (see Section 2.1.1 for harvest methodology) and includes data
for seven of the nine mangrove species known to occur in Kenya.
The harvest dataset is unbalanced with very few data points for
some species (Table 1). However, Rhizophora mucronata and
Avicennia marina are well represented in the dataset in terms of
sample size and these are two of the most dominant and widely
distributed mangrove species in Kenya. In common with most allo-
metric studies, there is a paucity of data from large diameter size
classes with 97% of the harvested trees in the current dataset
<20 cm in diameter. This means that the data range in the harvest
dataset does not fully encompass the upper values of diameter and
height recorded in the existing forest inventories.

Harvest data from a recent study conducted by WWF, Mozam-
bique and KMFRI in 2011 in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique
(Bosire et al., unpublished results) were used in this study for val-
idation purposes only and were not used to develop regression
models (data summarised in Table 1). The Zambezi validation data-
set comprises harvest data from 23 trees from six mangrove spe-
cies occurring in both Mozambique and Kenya.
2.1.1. Summary of harvest methodology
All of the studies listed in Table 1 employed similar methodol-

ogies for tree harvesting and determination of total live above-
ground biomass (but see individual papers for details). Harvested
trees were selected randomly and prior to harvest, the stem diam-
eter (cm) and total height (m) of each tree was recorded. Stem
diameter was measured at 1.3 m above-ground (DBH) except in
the case of Rhizophora trees where the highest prop root occurred
>1.3 m above-ground in which case diameter was measured at
�30 cm above the highest prop root. Trees were then harvested
at ground level and the fresh weight of component parts (stem,
branches, leaves and prop roots in the case of Rhizophora sp.)
was measured in the field. Sub-samples of component parts were
then oven dried to constant weight (80–85 �C in the case of all
studies apart from Poungparn et al. (2002) where fresh material
was dried at 110 �C) in order to calculate wet-dry weight ratios
(conversion factors). Conversion factors were then applied to con-
vert the fresh weight of each tree component to dry weight in kilo-
grams (kg DW) and summed giving total above-ground biomass in
kg DW. The study by Kirui (2006) employed a slightly different
methodology for determining the total above-ground biomass of
multi-stemmed Avicennia trees. Each stem arising from a common
butt was treated as an individual tree and the biomass of each stem
was calculated separately following a procedure outlined in Clough
et al. (1997) involving apportionment of the common butt.
2.2. Statistical analyses

2.2.1. Rationale for using mixed-effects models
Ecological datasets often display a complex structure where

data from individuals within populations are nested or grouped
by one or more factors. Such grouping factors could include for
example; the species and/or site which the individual belongs to,
an experimental treatment applied to a subset of individuals and
time series data. If such correlations or group effects are not ac-
counted for during analysis the standard errors of the regression
coefficients will tend to be underestimated due to inflation of the
effective sample size (Steele, 2008). Mixed-effects models not only
account for but explicitly model the variance due to group effects.

In mixed-effects models the intercept and regression coeffi-
cients can be assigned their own probability models and allowed
to vary by group (as random effects) around the overall population
mean (the fixed effects). This is particularly useful in studies where
the main target of inference is the wider population and predic-
tions are sought for new individuals within new groups, with an
appropriate measure of predictive uncertainty (Gelman and Hill,
2007). In addition, mixed-effects models deal well with unbal-
anced datasets (especially common in meta-analysis studies) and
provide a more robust estimation of regression coefficients for
groups where there is little information (i.e. a small sample size)
as additional information on the probability distribution of coeffi-
cients can be gained from the dataset as a whole (Dietze et al.,
2008).

2.2.2. Model specification and selection process
The power function equation (Eq. (1)) or its linearized form

(Eq. (2)) is commonly used as the underlying allometric scaling
relationship for biomass regression models (e.g. Brown et al.,
1989; Chave et al., 2005; Komiyama et al., 2008; Parresol, 1999).

y ¼ axb ð1Þ
lnðyÞ ¼ lnðaÞ þ b lnðxÞ þ ei ð2Þ

where y is the response variable, x is the predictive variable and a
and b are the allometric constants. Specifically, a is the scaling coef-
ficient (or intercept), b is the scaling exponent (or slope) and ei is the
error term which is assumed to be normally distributed
ei � N(0,r2). For mangroves, biomass regression models have been
developed using stem diameter (D) as the sole predictive variable
(Clough and Scott, 1989; Steinke et al., 1995). However, many stud-
ies have found that the inclusion of additional biometric variables
(e.g. tree height (H)) either fitted independently or as a combined
variable such as x = D � H or x = D2 � H have improved model fit
(Chave et al., 2005; Komiyama et al., 2002; Soares and Schaeffer-
Novelli, 2005). The inclusion of wood density as a predictive vari-
able in models has also been recommended (Chave et al., 2005;
Komiyama et al., 2005).

In the current study, a linear relationship was obtained between
predictive variables (diameter and height) and the response vari-
able (total above-ground biomass (AGB)) after transforming all
variables by natural log (Fig. 2) allowing for the use of regression
models of the form shown in Eq. (2). Wood density was not in-
cluded as a potential predictive variable as tree level wood density
data were not available in the harvest dataset used for model
development. The individual level grouping factor used in the cur-
rent study was a combined species_site indicator which grouped
the harvest data from individuals within each species at each site
in the dataset. For example data from Rhizophora trees at Kinondo
(Table 1) formed the group Rhiz_Kin and so on. In total there were
eighteen species_site groupings present within the harvest dataset.
It was necessary to combine species and site into one grouping
