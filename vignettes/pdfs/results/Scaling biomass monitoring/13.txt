980 R. Cohen et al. / Forest Ecology and Management 310 (2013) 968–982
Gang and Agatsiva (1992) the estimate of AGB from Slim et al.
(1996) was based on the application of their allometric equation
to Rhizophora trees within one 20 � 20 m mono-specific plot and
therefore cannot reasonably be assumed to represent the variabil-
ity of Rhizophora forest within Gazi Bay. The highest estimate from
Kirui et al. (2006) is more akin to the level of AGB found in man-
groves in South East Asia (Komiyama et al., 2008) and it is not clear
how their mean estimate was derived. In contrast to previous stud-
ies, this study has focused on providing estimates of mangrove AGB
at varying spatial scales. This different approach means that the
estimates provided here are not readily comparable with those
from previous biomass studies conducted in Kenya. However, to
facilitate some kind of comparison the outputs of the simulation
procedure (Section 2.2.4) were sub-set to provide an estimate of
mean AGB for just Rhizophora forest at Gazi Bay of 134.5 Mg ha�1

(95% PI range 125.1–146.8 Mg ha�1).
Estimates of biomass density (mean Mg ha�1) at large spatial

scales such as those produced in the current study can be regarded
as a comparative tool by which to assess the level of AGB at differ-
ent sites/regions or between countries or forest types. Levels of
mean AGB have been found to vary considerably between man-
grove forests across the globe (see review by Komiyama et al.,
2008) ranging between 31.5 Mg ha�1 (± s.d. 2.9) for pioneer man-
grove forest in French Guiana (Fromard et al., 1998) to
536.6 Mg ha�1 (95% CI range 327.6–743.5 Mg ha�1) for mangroves
in Micronesia (Donato et al., 2012). Such broad-scale variability can
be attributed to differences in floristic composition, climatic condi-
tions, hydrology, geomorphology, successional stage and distur-
bance history (Fromard et al., 1998).

The regional estimates of mean AGB (±95% PI) shown in Fig. 8.
represent a best attempt at summarising the level of AGB within
different mangrove regions in Kenya. The two regions with the
lowest estimated mean AGB were Mtwapa Creek (72.8 Mg ha�1,
95% PI range 61.4–91.9 Mg ha�1) and Mida Creek (77.1 Mg ha�1,
95% PI range 69.9–86.2 Mg ha�1) and are comparable to the level
of AGB (71–85 Mg ha�1) found in mixed mangrove forests domi-
nated by R. mucronata and A. marina in Sri Lanka (Amarasinghe
and Balasubramaniam, 1992). The estimate for Mida Creek is
somewhat lower than expected and could be due to insufficient
inventory data from this region (n = 14 plots) but it is also likely
reflective of the level of forest degradation in this area due to illegal
and poorly managed logging practices (Kairo et al., 2002). The re-
gion with the highest estimate of mean AGB was Kiunga NMR
(199.6 Mg ha�1, 95% PI range 178.6–225.3 Mg ha�1). This level of
AGB is comparable to that reported for mangroves in Micronesia
(Donato et al., 2012; Kauffman et al., 2011) and mature coastal
mangroves in French Guiana (Fromard et al., 1998) and exceeds
the estimate by Donato et al. (2011) of 169.9 Mg ha�1 for oceanic
mangroves in the Indo-Pacific region.

Although the estimates of AGB produced in this study are statis-
tically robust, it is important to note the underlying assumption
that estimates at large spatial scales have been obtained using a
sample which is representative of the variability in forest compo-
sition and structure within the area in question (Chave et al.,
2004). The estimates of mean AGB in this study were derived using
all available current inventory data for each region. It seems rea-
sonable to assume that due to the sampling strategy employed
(stratified random) and the comparatively large sampling effort
(total number of plots sampled) that the mangrove areas in the
South of Kenya (Gazi Bay, Mwache, Mtwapa Creek, South Coast
and Vanga) have been adequately sampled. In addition, the large
within-region variability in estimates of median AGB at the plot le-
vel (Fig. 7) would suggest that there has been no sampling bias in
terms of plot location, for example by preferentially locating plots
in areas likely to yield high biomass and that the range of possible
biomass values within each region has been adequately captured.
The regional estimates for Mida Creek and Lamu District (South
Lamu and Kiunga) are based on relatively small inventory datasets
(n = 14 plots in Mida Creek, 25 in South Lamu and 16 in Kiunga)
due to the larger resource requirement and practical difficulties
(e.g. accessibility) associated with sampling areas in the North.
While the sampling strategies employed in these regions (random
and stratified random) are appropriate from a statistical point of
view; it is recommended that further data collection is undertaken
in order to increase sample size and ensure representivity in these
regions. This is particularly important in the case of Lamu District
which covers a large geographical area and is worthy of further
division into smaller sub-regions. For example, the mangroves of
Dodori Creek (Dodori National Reserve, Lamu District) were not
sampled in the current study but should probably be considered
as a distinct mangrove system.

In considering the regional and Kenya-wide estimates of total
AGB provided in Table 5 it is acknowledged that: (1) the estimates
of mean AGB (±95% PIs) used in up-scaling are assumed to be
regionally representative as discussed above and (2) the uncer-
tainty associated with the estimates of mangrove cover derived
from the remote sensing data has not been accounted for. Bearing
in mind these caveats the estimates (±95% PIs) shown in Table 5
can still be viewed as a useful comparative overview of the level
of total AGB stocks currently held within each region. There is
undoubtedly scope for large-scale estimates to be further refined
in the future. In particular there is a need for current inventory
data to be collected within the regions Kilifi and Tana River (as de-
fined in this study) not only to constrain the regional estimates but
also the Kenya-wide estimate of total AGB. In addition, if and when
future remote sensing work allows for the detailed mapping of
mangrove cover and structural characteristics in each region it
may become possible (and desirable) to produce large-scale esti-
mates of AGB based on up-scaling by forest strata.

The stratification of forest cover is recommended for the report-
ing of forest carbon pools (IPCC, 2006) and there are a variety of
stratification options still under consideration for future REDD
reporting (Maniatis and Mollicone, 2010). Mangroves are generally
considered to display species zonation and have traditionally been
stratified by such ‘zones’ (Hogarth, 1999). However, not all man-
groves display well-defined patterns of zonation (e.g. Mida Creek)
and other options for stratification for example based on structural
characteristics may be more appropriate in some situations. Vari-
ous remote sensing techniques have been used in recent years to
map mangroves at fine to large spatial scales (see review by
Kuenzer et al., 2011). Such techniques offer the potential for fast
and repeatable estimates of cover, and in the case of radar remote
sensing above-ground biomass to be made based on mangrove
structural parameters (Fatoyinbo et al., 2008; Held et al., 2003;
Lucas et al., 2007).

It is anticipated that if required and pending any further collec-
tion of new harvest data, the model and methodology for uncer-
tainty propagation presented in the current study could be used
to produce estimates of mean AGB for use in future up-scaling
exercises based on some stratification system with only minor
modification to the existing procedures.
