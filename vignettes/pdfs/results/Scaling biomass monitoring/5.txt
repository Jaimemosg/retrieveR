Pate Island constitute the ‘‘South Lamu’’ study region. Kiunga NMR stands for Kiunga National Marine Reserve. Please note that the mangrove area defined as the "Tana River"
region in this study spans the official districts of Kilifi and Tana River in Kenya and encompasses the mangroves just North of Malindi to the border of Lamu District. Kenya GIS

factor due to the unbalanced nature of the harvest dataset which
has insufficient replication of species data at each site to allow sep-
aration of any possible variation in AGB attributable solely to either
factor. In addition, Zianis and Mencuccini (2004) showed that
within-species variability in allometric coefficients across sites is
just as large as the variability in coefficients across species. Given
that the harvest dataset comprises data from various studies any
differences between the species_site groupings could also poten-
tially incorporate an effect of study origin. However, harvest meth-
odologies are broadly consistent across studies therefore it is likely
the case that the random effects predictions are largely reflective of
the differences across groups due to species and site effects.

Linear mixed-effects models were fitted using the lme4 package
within R statistical software version 2.15.0 (Bates et al., (2011),
http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4). Prior to model fitting
the logged predictive variables were centred at their mean to re-
duce any correlation between intercept and slope coefficients.
Models were initially fitted using maximum likelihood (ML) esti-
mation and compared using the Deviance Information Criterion
(DIC) as outlined in Gelman and Hill (2007). In order to identify
the best fixed and random effects terms for inclusion in the final
model eight candidate models were fitted to the data (Table 2).
Model notation follows that of Gelman and Hill (2007) where ln(yi)
is the response (AGB in this study) for the ith individual, a is the
intercept, b represents the coefficients for the predictive variables
diameter (ln(xi)) and height (ln(zi)) and r2y is the residual or the
unexplained ‘within-group’ variance. The subscript term j[i] in-
dexes the ith individual within the jth group and denotes where
the intercept or a coefficient has been allowed to vary across
groups (j = 1, ..., J) as a random effect.

Model I was the simplest model and included a random effects
term for the intercept only whilst the slopes of both predictive
variables were kept constant across groups (Table 2). The inclusion
of a random effects term for ln(xi) and ln(zi) coefficients in models
II and III respectively led to a reduction in the DIC value in compar-
ison with model I. In order to ascertain if both diameter and height
were needed as predictive variables within the model; models IV
and V excluded each variable as a fixed effect (and hence as a ran-
dom effect) in turn. As shown in Table 2 there is clearly a need to
include both variables as fixed effects within the model. This is
especially evident in the case of model V where exclusion of diam-
eter from the model had a large impact on the DIC value. Models
