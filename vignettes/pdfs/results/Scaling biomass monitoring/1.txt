Mangroves are globally important carbon stores and as such have potential for inclusion in future forest-
based climate change mitigation strategies such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degrada-
tion (REDD+). Participation in REDD+ will require developing countries to produce robust estimates of
forest above-ground biomass (AGB) accompanied by an appropriate measure of uncertainty. Final esti-
mates of AGB should account for known sources of uncertainty (measurement and predictive) particu-
larly when estimating AGB at large spatial scales. In this study, mixed-effects models were used to
account for variability in the allometric relationship of Kenyan mangroves due to species and site effects.
A generic biomass equation for Kenyan mangroves was produced in addition to a set of species-site spe-
cific equations. The generic equation has potential for broad application as it can be used to predict the
AGB of new trees where there is no pre-existing knowledge of the specific species-site allometric rela-
tionship: the most commonly encountered scenario in practical biomass studies. Predictions of AGB using
the mixed-effects model showed good correspondence with the original observed values of AGB although
displayed a poorer fit at higher AGB values, suggesting caution in extrapolation. A strong relationship was
found between the observed and predicted values of AGB using an independent validation dataset from
the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique (R2 = 0.96, p = < 0.001). The simulation based approach to uncertainty
propagation employed in the current study produced estimates of AGB at different spatial scales (tree
– landscape level) accompanied by a realistic measure of the total uncertainty. Estimates of mangrove
AGB in Kenya are presented at the plot, regional and landscape level accompanied by 95% prediction
intervals. The 95% prediction intervals for landscape level estimates of total AGB stocks suggest that
between 5.4 and 7.2 megatonnes of AGB is currently held in Kenyan mangrove forests.

1. Introduction

Mangrove forests are now widely recognised as globally impor-
tant carbon (C) stores (Bouillon et al., 2008; Chmura et al., 2003;
Donato et al., 2011; McKee et al., 2007). Despite accounting for
just 0.7% of the world’s tropical forest cover (Giri et al., 2011) man-
groves play a disproportionately important role in the global C
cycle. Recent estimates suggest that as much as 20Pg of C is cur-
rently being stored in mangrove biomass, sediments and peat
world-wide (Donato et al., 2011). Mangroves do not merely seques-
ter and store C they also provide a number of other key ecosystem
services which are ecologically and economically important at local,
regional and global scales. Such services include but are not limited
to; coastal defence (Zhang et al., 2012), fisheries production
(Aburto-Oropeza et al., 2008), habitat provision for terrestrial and
aquatic fauna (Kathiresan and Bingham, 2001), timber and
fuelwood production (Dahdouh-Guebas et al., 2000), pollution
abatement (Wickramasinghe et al., 2009) and regulation of
sediment exchange between land and sea (Duarte et al., 2005).

The continued degradation and destruction of mangroves
world-wide has been highlighted in recent years (Alongi, 2002;
Giri et al., 2011). Mangroves are considered to be one of the most
threatened ecosystems on the planet with an estimated decline
in global cover of �35% during the period 1980–2000 (Valiela
et al., 2001). This decline is largely due to over-exploitation of
wood products, conversion to aquaculture, coastal development
and human settlement (Primavera, 2005). Although rates of
destruction may be slowing in some countries they generally re-
main high; for example Kenya experienced an estimated mean loss
of mangrove cover of �0.7% yr�1 during the period 1985–2010
