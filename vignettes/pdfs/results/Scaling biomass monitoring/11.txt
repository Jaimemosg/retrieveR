Fig. 7. Estimated median above-ground biomass (AGB) of each plot within the forest inventory dataset (±95% PI). Plots have been grouped according to the eight regions
identified in the inventory dataset. For each region plots appear in ranked order from low to high estimated AGB. The 95% PI is the difference between the 97.5% and 2.5%
quantiles of the simulated distributions of possible values of median AGB for each plot.

highest estimates were used (‘Kenya High’). Lamu District (South
Lamu + Kiunga) holds the highest proportion (�69–75% dependent
on Kenya total) of mangrove AGB in Kenya (Table 5). Despite hav-
ing one of the lowest estimates of mean AGB the estimated total
AGB of mangroves at Mida Creek is more than double that of Gazi
Bay due to the higher mangrove cover at Mida Creek.

The uncertainty around the estimates of total AGB are generally
well constrained for all regions (Table 5). However, the Low and
High estimates of total AGB for Kilifi and Tana River differ by a fac-
tor of �2.7. This constitutes another level of uncertainty for these
regions and consequently the overall total for Kenya which differs
by �8% between Low and High estimates.

4. Discussion

4.1. Applicability and interpretation of Model VIII

This study used mixed-effects modelling to account for both
species and site variability in the allometric relationship for man-
groves producing a generic equation for Kenyan mangroves and a
set of species-site specific equations. The procedure for uncertainty
propagation employed in the current study ensures that estimates
of AGB at different spatial scales are accompanied by a realistic
measure of the total uncertainty. It is important to note that
although mangroves have been used as a case study here, the kind
of models and methodologies presented can be regarded as broadly
applicable to forests in general.

The practical application of the equations developed in the cur-
rent study is dependent on the target of inference. The set of spe-
cies-site specific equations are only applicable to four species
within the Gazi Bay region and simulations using these equations
account for the uncertainty in predicting the AGB of a new tree
within a pre-existing group. In contrast, the generic equation has
a much broader application as it can be used to predict the AGB
of new trees where there is no pre-existing knowledge of the spe-
cific species-site allometric relationship: the most commonly
encountered scenario in practical biomass studies. The generic
equation offers a far better solution than simply disregarding the
additional uncertainty involved in applying an equation that was
perhaps derived for a different species and/or a different site.

The predictions of AGB from model VIII show good correspon-
dence with the observed values of AGB used to fit the model
(Fig. 3). Perhaps more importantly, the median fitted values of
AGB (±95% PIs) from model VIII show good overall correspon-
dence with the observed values of AGB for trees within the
Mozambican validation dataset (Fig. 6). This would seem to indi-
cate that accounting for variance due to species and site effects in
biomass regression models is important if they are to be used
effectively elsewhere to predict AGB. Indeed, a large proportion
of the total variance in model VIII was attributed to between-
group variability in the coefficients of the predictive variables
diameter and height (Fig. 4). Both species and site specificity in
the allometric relationship for mangroves is indicated by the
group-specific random effects (Fig. 5). Most groups show some
overlap in predicted random effects but there are some differ-
ences between species at the same site (species_Gaz groups)
and between sites for the same species (Rhiz_site groups). How-
ever the use of a combined species_site grouping factor precludes
any conclusion regarding the relative contribution of each factor
(species and site) to the total variance in the allometric relation-
ship. It is also not possible to formally assess the potential contri-
bution of a study effect to the predicted random effects in this
