Fig. 8. Estimated mean AGB (±95% PI) of mangroves within each region. The 95% PI
is the difference between the 97.5% and 2.5% quantiles of the simulated distribution
of possible values of mean AGB for each region.

study. However, as mentioned in Section 2.2.2 any such effect is
assumed to be minimal due to the general agreement in method-
ology across studies included in the harvest dataset. The only
study which differed notably in methodology was that of Lang’at
(2008) where total above-ground biomass comprised stem weight
only (Table 1). In this case the sample size was fairly small (15
trees) and re-fitting model VIII after excluding this dataset did
not substantially alter the fixed effects estimates, predicted ran-
dom effects or residual variance.

In modelling the covariance of the distribution of random ef-
fects, the constraints imposed by the mixed-effects model used
in the current study on the estimated correlation parameters
may be considered too restrictive when more than two coefficients
vary by group (Gelman and Hill, 2007). Although outwith the scope
of the current paper; an alternative approach for future study
would be to use a scaled inverse-Wishart distribution as the prior
for modelling the covariance matrix of the random effects in a fully
Bayesian model (Dietze et al., 2008; Gelman and Hill, 2007).
Ideally regression models should not be applied outwith the
data range for which they were derived (Chave et al., 2005; Chave
et al., 2004). The lack of large tree harvest data means that extrap-
olation is often a practical necessity when estimates of AGB are
needed for large trees within forest inventory datasets. In this
study, it is assumed that the log-log linear relationship will hold
for trees beyond the original data range. It is, however, acknowl-
edged that this may not be the case and that the estimates of
AGB for trees outwith the data range recorded in harvest dataset
will include additional uncertainty due to extrapolation. Only a
very small proportion of trees in the inventory dataset (0.1%) had
a recorded diameter exceeding that found within the harvest data-
set and none exceeded the height range. However, the effect of
having limited information regarding the allometric relationship
for large trees is apparent in the poorer model fit at higher AGB val-
ues (Fig. 3). It is also apparent (to some degree) in the width of the
prediction intervals around the larger trees in the validation data-
set and the estimates of AGB at the plot, regional and landscape le-
vel. This is presumably due to the fact that by accounting for the
covariance of the predictive uncertainty at the single tree level in
producing estimates of AGB at aggregated levels (e.g. a plot) the
aggregated predictive uncertainty is realistically larger than if the
AGB of multiple trees had simply been summed (Wutzler et al.,
2008). In addition, the greater width of the PIs for larger trees is
an inevitable consequence of using a log-normal model where
the variability is related to the mean on the linear scale. An ap-
proach to consider for future study would be to investigate the
use of alternative distributions for the variability.

The 95% PIs in the current study are generally well constrained
given that measurement and predictive uncertainty have been
fully propagated to estimates. In addition, prediction intervals take
into account both the uncertainty in estimating the conditional
mean of the response and the variability in the conditional distri-
bution of the response and as such are generally larger than the
frequentist confidence intervals employed to represent uncertainty
in most other studies. However, for a few of the plots in the inven-
tory dataset the upper limit of the PI around the median estimate
of AGB is exceptionally high (Fig. 7) and exceeds the highest levels
of AGB previously reported for mangroves. The effects of both
extrapolation and small plot size could possibly explain these ex-
treme upper PI values for selected plots. All of the affected plots
measure just 10 � 10 m and contain two or more large diameter
trees which in some cases exceed the maximum diameter
(48.9 cm) found in the harvest dataset. The presence of a few large
trees in a small plot can skew results, however tree level and sam-
pling uncertainties tend to be reduced in larger plots (Chave et al.,
2004).

4.2. Comparison and interpretation of large-scale AGB estimates

Previous allometry/biomass studies conducted in Kenya have
focused on the development and application of species-specific
allometric equations to mangroves at a particular site. As a result
existing published estimates of AGB for Kenyan mangroves are
on a species by site basis and in many cases refer to monoculture
plantation forest established at Gazi Bay (Kairo et al., 2009; Kairo
et al., 2008; Tamooh et al., 2009). Estimates of AGB for natural
mangrove forest in Kenya vary considerably between sites but also
between studies conducted at the same site. Within the Mida
Creek area Gang and Agatsiva (1992) estimated the AGB of Rhizo-
phora forest as 11.8 Mg ha�1. However, their estimate is based on
the data from just one plot and there is no mention of how this
estimate was derived (Gang and Agatsiva, 1992). For the same spe-
cies at Gazi Bay Slim et al. (1996) and Kirui et al. (2006) produced
substantially higher estimates of mean AGB at 249 Mg ha�1 (± s.d.
40.1) and 452.02 Mg ha�1 respectively. Similar to the study by
