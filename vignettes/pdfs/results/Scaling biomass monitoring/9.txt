Fig. 3. (a) Total above-ground biomass (AGB) in kg as measured for each tree in the
harvest dataset versus the corresponding fitted value (kg) from model VIII and (b)
as (a) but re-scaled to show in detail the correspondence between observed and
fitted values at the lower range of AGB. The reference lines shown in (a) and (b)
represent a 1:1 correspondence between observed and fitted values.

the fixed effects terms, the random effects terms (hatched bars) and the remaining
unexplained (residual) variance from Model VIII.

VIII is 6.3 kg and the mean bias (observed-fitted) in predictions is
an underestimate of just 0.06 kg. The model performs well at val-
ues of observed AGB 6 50 kg (Fig. 3(b)) which comprise 85% of
the total dataset. There is some divergence from the reference line
for the few trees in the harvest dataset with higher AGB values
(Fig. 3(a)). Poorer model fit at higher AGB is likely due to the pau-
city of harvest data from larger trees with just 11 out of 337 trees
in the dataset having an observed AGB P 200 kg. Further diagnos-
tic plots (data not shown) revealed no systematic trend in model
residuals when plotted against the fitted values and against each
of the predictive variables.

Mixed-effects models partition the total variance in the re-
sponse variable (AGB in this study) between the main components
of the model (Fig. 4). The proportional contribution of the random
effects terms (r2a, r2bx, r2bz) and the residual variance (r2y) to the to-
tal variance was calculated for each term as:

% contribution ¼ ððr2a=tot varÞ100Þ ð6Þ

where e.g. r2a is the variance in the model attributed to between-
group differences in the intercept and tot_var is the total variance
from model VIII calculated as the variance of the logged values of
total above-ground biomass of the 337 trees in the harvest dataset.
Thus, the contribution to the total variance attributable to the com-
bined fixed effects terms was calculated as:

% contribution ¼ ðððtot var� ðsumðr2a þ r2bx þ r2bz
þ r2yÞÞÞ=tot varÞ100Þ ð7Þ

As expected, most of the variability in AGB was accounted for in
model VIII by the fixed effects terms (Fig. 4). Together the random
effects terms accounted for 41% of the variance in AGB. Between-
group variability in the slopes of the predictive variables diameter
and height was very similar accounting for 18% and 19% of the total
variance respectively. In combination the fixed and random effects
explained 94% of the variability in AGB leaving a relatively small
residual variance of 6% (Fig. 4).

The random effects represent the group-specific departures
(either ±) from the fixed effects estimate of the intercept and the
coefficients for diameter and height. There is clearly some be-
tween-group variability in the random effects for the eight spe-
cies_site groups occurring in Kenya (Fig. 5). The 95% PI around
the random effects is more constrained for groups with a larger
sample size (Fig. 5) and there is some degree of overlap in the pre-
diction intervals between most groups.

The random effects for most groups fall within the bounds of
the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the fixed effects estimate
of each parameter (Fig. 5). However, the predicted random effect
for the intercept of group Rhiz_Gaz and the coefficient of height
for group Avic_Gaz show no overlap with the fixed effects esti-
mates for these parameters. For group Sonn_Gaz there is a pro-
nounced departure from both the fixed effects estimates and
from the predicted random effects for the other groups. Such devi-
ation from the fixed effects estimates suggest that the allometry for
these species_site groupings may be distinct from that of the other
groups in the harvest dataset and highlights the general need for
the inclusion of group effects in regression models.

3.2. Model validation

For harvested trees in the Zambezi Delta predictions of median
AGB (±95% PIs) from model VIII correspond well with the original
observed values of AGB (Fig. 6). A linear regression between the
logged observed values and predicted median values of AGB was
used to further assess the predictive ability of model VIII
(R2 = 0.96, p = < 0.001). The 95% confidence interval for the
intercept includes zero (�0.23 ± 0.37) and for the regression slope
includes one (1.01 ± 0.09). The uncertainty around predictions is
well constrained for trees with lower AGB but increases with
increasing predicted AGB.

3.3. Plot level AGB estimates

Plot level estimates of mangrove AGB vary greatly within and
between regions (Fig. 7). Within each study region (except Kiunga)
there are two orders of magnitude difference between the smallest
and largest plot estimates. If the 95% PIs are considered then the
scale of maximum AGB across regions ranges between
