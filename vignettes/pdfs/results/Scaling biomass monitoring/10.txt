Fig. 5. Group-specific random effects (±95% PI) for the intercept and the coefficients of diameter and height. The solid line at zero represents no departure from the fixed
effects estimate for each parameter and the dashed lines on either side are the upper and lower limits of the 95% CI of the fixed effects estimate. Species_site groups
correspond to the first four letters of the species followed by the first three letters of the site (see Table 1). Numbers in parentheses denote sample size for each group.

Fig. 6. Total above-ground biomass (AGB) in kg as measured for each tree in the
Zambezi harvest dataset versus the corresponding median fitted value (kg ±95% PI)
from model VIII. The 95% PI is the difference between the 97.5% and 2.5% quantiles
of the simulated distribution of possible values of median AGB for each tree. The
reference line represents a 1:1 correspondence between observed and fitted values.

�200 Mg ha�1 at Mida Creek to >2000 Mg ha�1 at Vanga. For each
region the uncertainty in estimates is tightly constrained for plots
with low values of AGB but there appears to be a general pattern of
larger prediction intervals around estimates for plots with higher
AGB (Fig. 7). For some regions there is considerable variation in
the PIs of plots with similar median AGB estimates (e.g. see
Mwache plots 45 and 46 in Fig. 7). It is likely that larger PIs around
the estimates of some plots is not associated with higher biomass
per se but is due to the presence of large diameter trees in these
plots for which the biomass has been estimated with relatively less
precision.
3.4. Regional level AGB estimates

As expected, estimates of mean AGB vary amongst the study re-
gions which span the entire Kenyan coastline (Fig. 8). There is a dif-
ference of >120 Mg ha�1 between the lowest estimate for
mangroves at Mtwapa Creek near Mombasa (73 Mg ha�1) to the
highest for mangroves within Kiunga NMR (200 Mg ha�1). How-
ever, there is a general overlap between the prediction intervals
of most regions and the estimates of mean AGB do not differ sub-
stantially between the regions Mwache, Gazi, South Coast, Vanga
and South Lamu. Uncertainty around the estimates of mean AGB
is reasonably well constrained with an absolute difference be-
tween upper and lower prediction limits of <50 Mg ha�1 for all
regions.

The regional level estimates of mean AGB (Fig. 8) and mangrove
cover (Table 4) were used in a basic up-scaling exercise in order to
give an indication of the total AGB of mangroves within each re-
gion and within Kenya as a whole (Table 5). Up-scaled values of to-
tal mangrove AGB in megatonnes (Mt) were calculated by
multiplying the regional level estimates of mean AGB (Mg ha-1)
shown in Fig. 8 by the corresponding estimate of total mangrove
cover (ha) for each region (Table 4). There was no inventory data
available for mangroves at Kilifi and Tana River therefore it was
not possible to estimate mean AGB for these regions. For the pur-
poses of up-scaling it was assumed that the mean AGB of man-
groves at Kilifi and Tana River lies somewhere between that of
Mtwapa Creek (the lowest regional mean) and Kiunga (the highest
regional mean). Thus for sites Kilifi and Tana River two sets of pos-
sible values of total AGB (‘Low’ and ‘High’) were calculated using
the lowest (Mtwapa Creek) and the highest (Kiunga) of the regional
level estimates of mean AGB. Consequently there are also two sets
of estimates of the total AGB of Kenyan mangroves; one in which
the lowest estimates for Kilifi and Tana River were added to the to-
tal AGB of the other regions (‘Kenya Low’) and one in which the
