during July 2010 and four 0.25 ha plots were inventoried during
August 2011. The smaller plots inventoried in 2010 were posi-
tioned randomly within the main identifiable mangrove zones
and included all trees DBH P 5 cm. The larger plots collected in
2011 were positioned using the same procedure as detailed above
for the large plots in Section 2.3.1 and included all trees within
each plot stem diameter P5 cm.

The remaining plot data (n = 88) from the Gazi Bay area were
collected in 2009 as part of two internationally funded short-term
projects. Eighteen 0.01 ha plots were inventoried in the area adja-
cent to Gazi village as part of a project entitled CAMARV (Capacity
Building for Mangrove Assessment, Restoration and Valuation in
East Africa) funded by the Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC) of the United Kingdom. Seventy 0.01 ha plots were invento-
ried as part of a UNDP-GEF Small Grants Programme project
co-ordinated by Gazi Womens Group. In both projects plots were
randomly positioned along a transect within each identifiable
mangrove zone and all trees within each plot were included in
the inventory.
2.3.3. Mwache and Mtwapa Creek
Mwache (4�20S, 39�330E) and Mtwapa Creek (3�570S, 39�430E) are

both examples of peri-urban mangroves due to their close proximity
to the city of Mombasa and the town of Mtwapa respectively. Both
areas are considered to be degraded due to a combination of sewage
pollution, timber over-exploitation and in the case of Mwache; the
heavy sedimentation and flooding associated with the El Niño event
of 1997–1998 (Kitheka et al., 2002). Inventory data from Mtwapa
Creek (n = 54) was collected in 2010 as part of a study by Okello
(unpublished results). Data from Mwache (n = 67) was collected in
2011 as part of a study conducted by Kaino (2013) and funded by
the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA).
Both studies used plot sizes of 0.01 ha. Plots at Mtwapa Creek were
positioned along transects running perpendicular to the shoreline at
�50 m intervals and all trees with stem diameter P2.5 cm were
measured. At the Mwache site plots were positioned along transects
running perpendicular to the shoreline at 100 m intervals using a
stratified sampling scheme based on observed differences in forest
composition and structure. All trees with stem diameter P2 cm
within each plot were measured.

2.3.4. South Coast
Forest inventory data from the South Coast (Shirazi, Ramisi,

Funzi and Bodo) was collected in 2007 by KMFRI as part of a Kenya
government funded project. In total there are data from one hun-
dred and twenty-three 0.01 ha plots comprising; Shirazi (n = 43),
Ramisi (n = 22), Funzi (n = 24) and Bodo (n = 34). Plots were posi-
tioned at �20 m intervals along transects running perpendicular
to the shoreline and all trees with stem diameter P5 cm were in-
cluded in the inventory.

2.3.5. Vanga
Mangroves close to the Kenya–Tanzania border were invento-

ried by KMFRI during January 2012. Plots inventoried within the
Vanga mangrove system number 83 in total and are of variable size
(sixty-nine 0.01 ha, six 0.04 ha and eight 0.0025 ha (5 � 5 m)
plots). Plots were positioned within each identifiable mangrove
zone using a stratified random sampling strategy and all trees
P2.5 cm in diameter were recorded.

3.1. Model VIII summary and key features

Overall, there is good correspondence between the fitted values
of AGB (as estimated from model VIII) and the original observed
values of AGB for trees in the harvest dataset (Fig. 3(a) and (b)).
The mean absolute error (MAE) in predictions of AGB from model
