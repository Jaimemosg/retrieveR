Fig. 2. Relationship between above-ground biomass (AGB) and stem diameter (D)
of harvested mangrove trees after transformation by natural log. The vertical
arrangement of data points at approximately ln(D) = 1.6 is mostly due to data from
the study by Kairo et al. (2009) which focused on harvesting trees from plantation
forests of known age whereby a large proportion of data points arising from this
study were of similar stem diameter (�5 cm).

were also fitted using two new combined predictive variables:
ln(xizi) and lnðx2i ziÞ, both of which were logged and centred prior
to model fitting as before. However, as shown in Table 2 models
VI and VII using the combined variables displayed a poorer overall
fit in comparison with models II and III (Table 2). Model VIII had
the lowest DIC value of all the models under consideration indicat-
ing that the inclusion of a random effects term for the coefficients
of both ln(xi) and ln(zi) was needed in order to account for variabil-
ity in AGB across groups.

Model VIII was considered to be the most appropriate model
overall and was subsequently re-fitted using restricted (or resid-
ual) maximum likelihood (REML) estimation in order to produce
the best unbiased estimates of variance and co-variance parame-
ters (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000). In model VIII the terms aj, bjx and
bjz signify that these parameters have themselves been modelled
yielding a partial pooling estimate of a and the coefficients bx
and bz for each group along with an estimate of the overall popu-
lation mean and the ‘between-group’ variance (estimated from
the data). The group-level model for model VIII can be written as:

where the overall mean across all groups (the fixed effects esti-
mates) for the intercept, slope of ln(xi) and the slope of ln(zi) are de-
noted by la, lbx and lbz respectively. The between-group variance
in the intercept, slope of ln(xi) and the slope of ln(zi) are given as
r2a and r2bx and r2bz respectively. The parameters q1, q2 and q3 are
also estimated as the between-group correlations of the a’s and
b’s (e.g. q1rarbx is the correlation between the group intercepts
and slopes of ln(xi)).
2.2.3. Simulation-based approach to biomass estimation
In order to estimate the biomass of mangroves along the entire

Kenyan coastline the equations developed in this study were ap-
plied to a forest inventory dataset (detailed in Section 2.3) compris-
ing 498 plots inventoried during the period 2007–2012. The
modelling process described in Section 2.2.2 generated a mean bio-
mass equation and a suite of specific equations; one for each of the
eighteen species_site groups. The mean equation is comprised of
the fixed effects estimates and can be regarded as a generic equa-
tion for Kenyan mangroves. The group specific equations represent
the group departures from the fixed effects estimates (fixed effect
estimates ± the group specific random effects) and are only valid
for the specific groupings from which they were originally derived.
Eight of the group specific equations can potentially be applied to
the forest inventory dataset to estimate biomass as the remaining
ten equations are only valid for species_site combinations occurring
outwith Kenya. Therefore, group specific equations were applied to
estimate the biomass of individual trees within the inventory data-
set if those trees fell into one of the pre-existing groups identified
within the harvest dataset. For example the group specific equation
for Rhiz_Kin was applied to inventoried Rhizophora trees at Kinondo
and so forth. In cases where inventoried trees did not fall into one of
the pre-existing groups their biomass was estimated using the gen-
eric equation. The simulation-based approach adopted in this study
allows for the propagation of measurement, parameter and residual
uncertainty to estimates of biomass at the individual tree, plot and
regional level.
2.2.4. Simulations for individual tree biomass
The above-ground biomass of each tree in the inventory dataset

was simulated 10,000 times using a new set of simulated values for
each iteration. In order to propagate measurement uncertainty
possible values of stem diameter ln(Dsim) and height ln(Hsim) for
each tree were randomly sampled from a normal distribution with
mean equal to the observed value and one standard deviation con-
servatively assumed to be 5% and 10% of the observed diameter
and height respectively. These assumed values of measurement
uncertainty are consistent with the findings of previous studies
(Chave et al., 2004; Gregoire et al., 1990; Phillips et al., 2000).

To propagate parameter uncertainty, possible values of the
fixed effects intercept (afixsim) and coefficients for stem diameter
(bxfixsim) and height (bzfixsim) were sampled from a multivariate nor-
mal distribution around means equal to la, lbx and lbz from model
VIII using the variance-covariance matrix of the fixed effects. In
cases where the generic equation was applicable (to estimate the
biomass of new trees in new groups) simulated values of the ran-
dom effects for the intercept (aransim) and the coefficients for stem
diameter (bxransim) and height (bzransim) were generated by sampling
from a multivariate normal distribution around means equal to
zero using the variance-covariance matrix of the group level (or
mean) random effects (Eq. (3)). In cases where a group specific
equation was applicable (to estimate the biomass of new trees in
existing groups) possible values of the random effects were simu-
lated as for the generic equation, however values were sampled
around means equal to the group specific random effects for the
intercept and coefficients and used the variance-covariance matrix
