of the group specific random effects. Simulated values were then
used in Eq. (4) to calculate AGB biomass (ln(AGBpred)) for each tree:

lnðAGBpredÞ ¼ asim þ ððbxfixsim þ bxransimÞ lnðDsimÞÞ
þ ððbzfixsim þ bzransimÞ lnðHsimÞÞ ð4Þ

where asim is the un-centred intercept (calculated as shown in Eq.
(5)) and corrects for the use of mean centred predictive variables
diameter and height during model development (Section 2.2.2).

asim ¼ ðafixsim þ aransimÞ � ððbxfixsim þ bxransimÞ�xÞ
� ððbzfixsim þ bzransimÞ�zÞ ð5Þ

where �x and �z are the mean logged values of diameter and height
respectively from the harvest dataset. In order to account for resid-
ual uncertainty in biomass estimates; possible values of biomass
(ln(AGBEst)) were randomly sampled from a normal distribution
with mean equal to ln(AGBpred) and standard deviation equal to ry
(the standard deviation of r2y) from model VIII. Values of ln(AGBEst)
were then back-transformed by taking the exponent; producing
10,000 estimates of AGB (in kg DW) for each tree. The estimates
for all trees within a plot were then summed at each iteration point
yielding a distribution of 10,000 possible estimates of total biomass
for each plot. The median was taken as the plot level biomass esti-
mate as this provided the most typical value from skewed distribu-
tions of the simulations. The quantiles from the distribution of plot
estimates were used for calculating the 95% prediction interval (95%
PI) at the plot level.

2.2.5. Calculation of regional level prediction intervals
In order to upscale biomass estimates from plot to regional le-

vel, plots were first grouped according to the mangrove regions
identified in the inventory dataset (Table 3). Plots within Lamu Dis-
trict were further sub-divided into those within Kiunga National
Marine Reserve (NMR) and those outwith the reserve (hereafter
‘‘South Lamu’’). Due to their close geographical proximity plots
from Shirazi, Ramisi, Funzi and Bodo were aggregated to form
the region ‘‘South Coast’’. The mean biomass estimate was calcu-
lated for each iteration (across all plots within a region) yielding
a distribution of 10,000 possible mean biomass estimates. The
mean of this distribution was taken as the regional level biomass
estimate (Mg ha�1) and provides the expected value of AGB taking
into account the whole scale of values present in a specific geo-
graphical area. The quantiles from the distribution were used to
calculate the 95% PI at the regional level.

2.2.6. Model validation
The predictive performance of model VIII was evaluated using a

harvest dataset from the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique (Table 1).
The simulation process detailed in Section 2.2.4 was repeated for
the 23 trees in the Zambezi dataset. For each tree the median fitted
value of AGB (kg) was obtained along with the 95% PI for the
median.

2.3. Forest inventory dataset

A summary of the forest inventory dataset is provided in Table 3,
recent estimates of mangrove cover by region are provided in Table 4
and the location along the Kenyan coastline of each region is shown
in Fig. 1. The cover estimates in Table 4 were derived from 2.5 m res-
olution SPOT remote sensing imagery acquired over the Kenyan
coastline during 2009–2011 (see Rideout et al., 2013 for further de-
tails). The inventory dataset is a combination of data collected by
this and other studies. All studies conducted prior to 2010/2011
had the objectives of characterising and investigating mangrove
structural variability and change in the southern coastal region.
However, in the current study sampling strategy was tailored (as
much as was practicable) towards facilitating both a statistical and
remote sensing based approach to biomass estimation along the en-
tire coastline. Thus studies within the inventory dataset differ in
terms of sampling strategy and plot size. There is also an obvious
bias in total sampling effort towards sites in the south coast
(Table 3).

In general all inventory studies followed a standardised meth-
odology of within-plot data collection. In all studies the species,
stem diameter and total height of all trees within each plot which
met the diameter measurement threshold were recorded. Stem
diameter was recorded to the nearest millimetre and was mea-
sured at 1.3 m aboveground (DBH) except in the case of Rhizophora
sp. where stem diameter was measured at �30 cm above the high-
est prop root if this occurred above 1.3 m. In cases where trees
branched below 1.3 m (common in Avicennia sp.) and branches
met the diameter measurement threshold; the diameter and
height of each branch was recorded separately. In the current study
total tree height was measured using an ultrasonic vertex hypsom-
eter (Haglöf, Sweden). In all other studies tree height was mea-
sured using a graduated pole.

2.3.1. Mida Creek and Lamu District
Forest inventory data from the Mida Creek area and Lamu District

was collected as part of this study during June–August 2010 and
2011. Mida Creek (3�200S, 40�000E) is situated mid-way along the
Kenyan coast �23 km south of the town Malindi in Kilifi District.
Some of the mangrove forest in this area falls within the boundaries
of Watamu Marine National Park (WNMP); however the majority is
outwith the protected area. Regardless of location (within or outside
of WNMP) harvesting of mangroves is currently prohibited in the
Mida Creek area. In total 14 plots within the Mida Creek area were
inventoried comprising nine 0.04 ha (20 � 20 m) plots, four
0.25 ha (50 � 50 m) plots and one 0.5 ha (100 � 50 m) plot. None
of the inventoried plots were located within the marine park.

The Lamu archipelago extends between 2�220S, 40�480E in the
South and 1�440S, 41�300E in the North and is part of Lamu District.
Lamu District currently holds the greatest proportion of remaining
mangrove cover in Kenya (Table 4). Mangroves in the extreme
north, close to the border with Somalia are part of Kiunga NMR
and are considered to be the only remaining examples of relatively
‘‘pristine’’ mangrove forest in Kenya. Forty-one plots within Lamu
District were inventoried comprising twenty-five 0.04 ha plots, fif-
teen 0.25 ha plots and one 0.5 ha plot. Within Lamu District sites
visited included: Kiunga NMR (n = 16 plots), Pate Island area
(n = 15) and Lamu Island area (n = 10).

Plots inventoried in Mida Creek (n = 6) and Lamu District (n = 8)
during 2010 were all 0.04 ha in size. Plots were positioned at ran-
dom within Rhizophora zones and all trees within each plot with
stem diameter P2.5 cm were measured. Plots inventoried during
2011 were a mixture of 0.04 ha plots (Mida Creek: n = 3,
Lamu District: n = 17) located at random within randomly chosen
map grid squares (grid resolutions of 500 � 500 metres and
1000 � 1000 m) and larger plots (0.25 ha and 0.5 ha) which were
positioned at random within larger areas pre-identified using
optical and radar remote sensing imagery. These pre-identified
areas were judged to be potentially distinct from each other in
terms of forest structure/biomass and also to broadly represent
the main levels of structural variation within the study region as
a whole. This more targeted plot location strategy was for the
purpose of facilitating future remote sensing work. All plots inven-
toried in 2011 included all trees within each plot which met the
criteria of having stem diameter P5 cm.

2.3.2. Gazi Bay
The Gazi Bay inventory consists of 116 plots in total. As part of

this study twenty-four 0.01 ha (10 � 10 m) plots were inventoried
