The System-Wide Program on Collective Action and Property Rights 

(CAPRi) is an initiative of the 15 centers that belong to the Consultative 

Group on International Agricultural Research. CAPRi fosters research 

and promotes collaboration on instititutional aspects of natural resource 

management between CGIAR centers and National Agricultural Research 

Institutes. CAPRi contributes to policies and practices that reduce 

rural poverty by analyzing and disseminating knowledge on ways that 

collective action and property rights institutions influence the efficiency, 

equity, and sustainability of natural resource use. Its Secretariat is hosted 

by the International Food Policy Research Instituteâ€™s Environment and 

Production Technology Division
