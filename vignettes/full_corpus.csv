"2","pmg membership a key question is whether resource-poor and smallholder farmers benefit from pmgs. the results show that they do membership increases with per capita livestock wealth but decreases with per capita farmland. it also appears that ownership of communication technologies reduces the probability of participating in collective marketing, perhaps indicating that farmers who lack alternative sources of market information may view pmgs as repositories of such information. however, households with less contact with extension services were also less likely to join pmgs, as were those with less contact with ngos common providers of agricultural extension.

"3","governance of marketing groups an important aspect of governance of pmgs are the rules defining the norms of operations, roles, and responsibilities of various organs and members. all the pmgs have written bylaws governing the running of their groups. the by-laws put more emphasis more on the obligations of the members to the group but are relatively silent on the obligations of the group to members. for example, the by-laws require that members sell their grain through the pmg, make requisite payments and or contributions, prioritize farming of marketable crops, and contribute actively to the development of the group. fair and transparent elections are not also consistently practiced, reducing the confidence of members in the group leadership.

"5","constraints to collective marketing the three most important constraints to collective marketing were cited as lack of credit, price variability, and low volumes. given the low level of market development and lack of service providers in many rural areas, pmgs are unlikely to prosper in a business as usual policy environment. policies that spur mpg growth would include an enabling legal framework, improved access to market information, support to strengthen business skills, and access to essential finance and credit facilities. in kenya, pmgs are registered as self-help groups shags but lack legal status as business enterprises, which restricts access to essential credit. lack of legal standing also means that pmgs can neither be sued nor sue in case of any liability. this drastically diminishes the incentive for financial institutions to do business with pmgs.

"6","pmgs would benefit from a legal framework that facilitates their transition to cooperative societies and a policy framework that seeks to promote, guide, and discipline the operation of markets under the liberalized environment. this may include laws dealing with adoption of quality grades and standards, good agricultural practices, and environmental and consumer protection issues.","pdfs/results/Collective action for poverty reduction/10.txt","8","10","en"
"8","with imperfect markets and limited institutions to support market functions, liberalization strategies have failed to integrate smallholder farmers in less favored areas into the market system. this analysis has shown that pmgs were able to pay higher prices to members and improve opportunities for resource-poor farmers to benefit from markets. pmgs improved market opportunities by bulking, storage, grading, sorting, and selling the produce. the links to secondary and tertiary markets were enhanced through better coordination of production and marketing activities. the pmgs do not benefit only wealthier farmers. on the contrary, the incentive for joining seems to be higher for those with less farmland.","pdfs/results/Collective action for poverty reduction/10.txt","8","10","en"
"9","nevertheless, only relatively successful pmgs were able to exploit this potential. the challenge is to mobilize farmers in participatory governance, provide start-up capital to pmgs, and provide training in business skills. in addition, pmgs need to be supported to transition into legal business entities to facilitate increased access to financial and other services from the formal sector.

"10","the effectiveness of the pmgs was hampered by their lack of cash capital to pay in time for produce deliveries. cash-constrained farmers found it difficult to delay cash payments, even when future prices would be higher. the ability of the pmgs to access working capital through access to credit is therefore critical. one strategy would be to explore the use of crop inventory as collateral for financial credit. another option would be to pay farmers a portion of the grain value at the time of delivery so that they can meet immediate needs while benefiting from better prices by delaying full payments.

"11","in addition, the establishment of a union of pmgs for expanding horizontal and vertical coordination of production and marketing activities may help address the problem of low volumes and price variability and make the groups economically attractive to financial institutions. the seasonal price differentials may also be exploited further through bulking and storage during periods of excess supply and selling when prices improve. these strategies should be pursued together with alternative options for smoothing supply through investments in drought mitigating and water harvesting techniques that would enable farmers in drought-prone areas manage production risk more effectively.","pdfs/results/Collective action for poverty reduction/10.txt","8","10","en"

"32","this study shows that collective action in watershed management can be captured through a set of variables that indicate the capacity of communities to design and enforce certain common institutional arrangements, and their ability to mobilize local financial and labor resources for watershed investments. the index for enabling institutions is positively associated with rainfall, number of castes, number of phones, and female employment in watershed works in the community, and decreases with larger groups and degraded land in the community, market access, and urbanization. the organizational performance index decreased with rainfall, size of the group, number of seasonal migrants, and distance from the seat of the local administration, but increased with area of the village, flow of information within the village, share of land under village commons, equitable distribution of benefits and preference given for employment of the rural poor and female workers. in most watershed communities the level of collective action is very limited only 1 0%1 5% of watershed communities were able to significantly harness the potential of collective action to achieve desired economic and environmental objectives. there is a strong correlation between higher levels of collective action and higher performance of communities in facilitating resource-improving investments, especially water-harvesting structures and good management of these resources. the effectiveness of watershed groups in terms of their performance on this index depended on other variables such as rainfall, access to education and other social services, governance structures, resource degradation or scarcity problems, and the quality of the road linking the village. on the other hand, the correlation between higher collective action and changes in the index of poverty parameters was not statistically significant.

"192","a second factor is the degree of autonomy a group has to take collective action on its own or within a nested institutional setting, and this factor can depend on the macro political-institutional environment in which individuals find themselves. for many local groups, past attempts to take collective action proved dangerous. in a highly authoritarian regime, independent action is perceived as threatening to the center. individuals who have lived in such regimes for long periods of time are always nervous about independent action, even when assured that the regime has changed. in addition, the capacity to create a private association without long and bureaucratic processes or expensive filing of documents greatly enhances the capabilities of local people to solve problems.","pdfs/results/Collective action for sustainable development/5.txt","8","5","en"

"619","often the more variable the resource, the more flexible are the property rights that develop over it. water rights are particularly fluid, changing by season and year, depending on the availability of the resource and demands for water. similarly, many customary rangeland management systems negotiate access rights depending on factors like weather and the social relations between the groups.this flexibility provides a measure of security in times of drought or other disasters, by creating reciprocal expectations of resource sharing between groups.","pdfs/results/Collective action for sustainable development/8.txt","8","8","en"
"720","another source of change in property rights comes from the interaction between types of law. the different legal frameworks do not exist in isolation, but influence each other. changes in state law can influence local custom, but changes in customary practices can also lead to changes in state law. for state law to be effective on the ground, it must be implemented effectively. legal literacy programs may be needed to inform the publicans even government officials about changes in the laws.","pdfs/results/Collective action for sustainable development/8.txt","8","8","en"

"1018","effective resource management entails balancing benefit entitlements and responsibilities of property rights. after failing to effectively manage natural resource systems centrally, many governments are now undertaking decentralization and devolution programs to transfer responsibility for resource management to local governments and user groups. unfortunately, many such programs emphasize the transfer of responsibilities without transferring the corresponding rights. as a result, user groups may lack the incentive, and even the authority, to manage the resource.","pdfs/results/Collective action for sustainable development/8.txt","8","8","en"

"148","although property rights have a powerful influence on human welfare and natural resource management, this key institution is complex. property rights do change over time, but legislative reform alone is unlikely to change the manifestation of property rights on the ground. rather, change occurs through the social and power relations and negotiations between different groups, which may appeal to a variety of legal bases for claiming property rights. instead of looking for simple solutions to property rights issues, it is more useful to try to understand the complexity. this approach involves looking at the claims and the bases of the claims made by individuals, groups, or government entities to different bundles of rights over the resource and at the different types of law that pertain to the use or management of the resource. security of tenure is important, but so is flexibility to respond to changing conditions that affect resource use and property rights.

"721","even within the same community, people cooperate to provide certain public goods but not others. it is possible to explore this variability by asking, how do one individuals benefits change depending on how many other people actually contribute to a specific activity? using game theory to examine an individuals incentives to contribute to a public good helps to highlight the exact nature of the interdependency among community members in terms of the decision to contribute or not.","pdfs/results/Collective action for sustainable development/9.txt","8","9","en"

"1214","in the fourth example the individual may prefer not to contribute if no one else does and also prefer to free ride if everyone else contribute seven though all members would be better off if each one contributed his or her own share. in this case, the incentive structure resembles a prisoners dilemma. this situation is likely to occur when returns to contributions increase but at a decreasing rate for example, certain soil erosion control measures. such an incentive structure may also result when returns are highly variable, as they are, for example, for investments in agroforestry techniques in regions with high climatic variability. managing this type of incentive structure is likely to be the most costly.","pdfs/results/Collective action for sustainable development/9.txt","8","9","en"
"1312","finally, it may be the case that it would be best, under existing conditions, not to provide the public good at all. in other words, social returns to a certain public good may simply be too low for it to be in the interest of the community members to provide that good.","pdfs/results/Collective action for sustainable development/9.txt","8","9","en"

"942","the second is that land policy development has tended to follow sectoral paths or foci or to be sector-driven with little or no co-ordination or harmonization with policies regarding other sectors. as a result land policies have failed to provide broader ranging prescriptions for the management of cross-cutting issues such as those impinging on the environment and poverty reduction.","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/43.txt","8","43","en"

"5102","the actual sequencing of activities and events in the trajectory of land policy development has, however, varied across countries. while some countries have initiated the process by first identifying key land related issues and problems through public consultations of various degrees of intensity, others have proceeded through state commissioned researches or position papers. yet others have, through constitutional provisions as well as primary and subsidiary legislation, simply dealt with land related issues and problems without any specific and coherent articulation. in this latter respect, land policy development has followed rather than preceded the promulgation of land legislation. it is important to remember, however, that whatever route is taken, detailed policy development and legislative and institutional reform should take place through a phased and iterative process rather than on a sequential linear model. the major stages in the road map for reform should, nonetheless, be set out with clear milestones to which the key stakeholders subscribe. that roadmap should avoid detailed prescriptions and timetables for institutional reform unless it is quite clear that these are feasible and that associated costs have been budgeted for.","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/45.txt","8","45","en"

"5122","5.2.2 lack of capacity to manage change the second typical impediment to land policy implementation is that in many countries the task of implementation is assigned to existing institutions or agencies responsible for the administration of the land sector. the problem is that the orientation of these agencies often stands as a major obstacle to change and innovation. there are three major reasons for this. first most land administration institutions or agencies draw their mandates from a colonial heritage characterized by operational conservatism. that heritage is not only inflexible and driven by path dependent objectives; it is also fundamentally averse to change and adaptation. second, most of these institutions or agencies are not just slow or inefficient; they also lack the technological know-how required to manage contemporary land reform programmes. third the bureaucratic structures developed around these institutions or agencies are not only complex and inaccessible, but may also be deeply implicated in patronage and corruption. many observers have therefore concluded that existing land administration institutions or agencies in africa are virtually incapable of managing systems and processes which require transparency and accountability. 5.2.3 defects in policy development the third impediment is that the process of policy development itself has proved to be defective in several countries. desktop research leading to quick fixes has, in several countries, produced policy prescriptions that do not answer to the needs of those individuals and communities who depend on land resources for their livelihoods. the idea of stakeholder and civil society participation is still regarded by many governments as an usurpation of their residual responsibility to direct and implement public policy. in many countries formerly under british colonial rule, the process of policy development still proceeds primarily by way of cabinet briefs and white or green papers rather than through public enquiry and consultation. attempts to implement policies devised in this manner have often been resisted or ignored by their intended targets. ","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/50.txt","8","50","en"
"872","the fourth impediment is that a number of policies have been prepared in the absence of adequate baseline data on the conditions of land as an integrated political, economic and social system. in addition, in many african countries land data are still manually operated and inaccurately recorded. efforts to put together efficient land information systems have been hampered by lack of adequate resources and modern technology. land policies prepared in this manner have led to prescriptions that do not adequately reflect the realities obtaining in the land sector.","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/50.txt","8","50","en"
"1022","the fifth impediment to land policy implementation is the evident lack of implementation infrastructure in terms of capacity, financial resources and institutional arrangements. donor assistance in correcting this deficiency has not always been reliable and sustainable. in such circumstances, policies, however comprehensive or innovative simply cannot be implemented. ","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/50.txt","8","50","en"
"318","5.3.1 the scope of a land policy implementation framework land policy implementation entails the systematic identification and execution of all steps necessary for the attainment of the goals and prescription set out in the national land policy. it is the translation of policy into a programme of land reform designed to deliver a wide range of services and benefits to the land using public and to sectors which depend on the land system for value addition. broadly speaking, that range includes, but is not limited to, the redistribution of land resources, the delivery of secure land rights, the improvement of sustainable methods of land use, the reorganization of land administration structures and services and the facilitation of the support services infrastructure required for optimum development of the land and related sector functions. the greater the number of elements in that range the more comprehensive will be the policy development process as well as the implementation steps which seek to deliver them. efficient, cost-effective and sustainable delivery of that range of services and benefits require that a number of additional steps be taken beyond the conclusion and presentation of national land policy.","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/51.txt","8","51","en"
"5131","the first step in effective land policy implementation is the design of realistic and achievable implementation strategies. important elements in that design are the preparation of a comprehensive checklist of activities to be included in an implementation plan and programme, assessment of the capability of the various agencies whose participation is needed and the mapping out of the terrain both physical and cultural which is likely to be affected by the implementation process. the crucial thing to appreciate here is that the implementation process is more than just technical, it is a deeply social and political exercise. ","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/51.txt","8","51","en"
"882","the second step is the preparation of an action plan. this must involve realistic programming and sequencing, proper costing, accurate assessment of financial and technological needs, along with capacity building and mobilization of resources required for the short, medium and long term implementation of key components of the policy. because programmes contemplated in land policies cannot be implemented en bloc, good practice demands that the implementation of certain aspects be preceded by piloting in order to test novel approaches and methodologies. such piloting enables policy-makers to take lessons learnt on board before scaling up implementation programmes on a regional or national scale. ","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/51.txt","8","51","en"
"962","further, even the best designed land policy implementation processes will barely get off the ground unless sufficient financial, technical, logistical and human resources have been secured. caution must be taken to avoid donor-driven processes since these sometimes attract only short to medium term funding. enduring land policy reforms must therefore be cost effective and financially selfsustaining. consequently african governments would do well to develop land service delivery systems that are affordable for the majority of the population.","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/51.txt","8","51","en"
"2112","5.3.4 mobilization of political commitment the third step is to ensure a high level of political commitment by the governing elites. the importance of political commitment cannot be over-emphasized. many policy components are bound to be unpopular with and therefore resisted by some segments of the population. this will be the case with any components calling for widespread re-distribution of land or the conversion of absolute land rights to systems which restore radical title to the state as was the case with the agrarian programmes carried out in egypt in the 1950and more recently in ethiopia, zimbabwe, and the former portuguese colonies. such resistance can easily frustrate the successful delivery of services intended for vulnerable groups in society. further, reform packages contained in land policies often prove to be onerous and therefore require diversion of resources from other social and economic programmes. ","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/52.txt","8","52","en"
"319","the nature and extent of political commitment will understandably vary from one country to another. in certain situations such commitment may take the form of re attribution of the land reform portfolio to the most powerful offices in the land such as the presidency. more often though, this commitment entails the establishment of dedicated land reform ministries or autonomous institutions whose exclusive function is the execution of programmes outlined in the policy. only then will the goals of the national land policy remain part of the development agenda of the state.","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/52.txt","8","52","en"
"5141","the fourth step in effective land policy implantation is to maintain continuous public ownership and acceptance of the main elements of the policy. without effective engagement of primary stakeholders at all stages in the implementation process leadership per se will not guarantee the delivery of outcomes contemplated in the policy. it is important that stakeholder engagement continues beyond completion of the policy development stage. experience has shown that the implementation of land policies will move much faster where such engagement is organized in terms of decentralized structures that are fully controlled by those targeted in land policies. the participation of women, who remain the primary users of land in rural africa, remains critical in this regard. consequently, implementation processes should strike a balance between the roles of relevant central, regional and local entities, institutions and groups in order to ensure that public engagement in land services delivery remains effective. ","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/52.txt","8","52","en"
"7131","placing decision-making powers at the local level is arguably the most efficient way to secure land rights of individual households and communities, even though some form of nationwide monitoring and review may be required. in this regard, land policy implementation processes should aim to ensure that public sector land institutions work in collaboration with local structures in order to bring services closer to the people and that they build on local innovations by informal and indigenous authorities as is often the case in regard to local land parcel demarcations and documentation systems and dispute settlement procedures, many of which are time-tested and have served the people well in the absence of intervention by the state.","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/52.txt","8","52","en"
"2121","5.3.6 legislating land policy components the fifth step is to identify those components of the policy which must be legislated and the preparation of instruments and development of structures and procedures for the management of those components. in most cases the components requiring legislation and the design of new institutional structures will be contained in the policy document itself. it is reasonable to expect nonetheless that new laws will need to be enacted, existing ones revised or amended and institutions designed or re-designed before many aspects of a new policy can be operationalised. it is advisable to take these steps as part of the preparatory stages of the implementation programme. what is important however, is to avoid unnecessary proliferation of legislative and institutional structures as has happened in a number of countries in east and southern africa. apart from the fact that such proliferation adds to complexity, more often than not, it increases the costs of the implementation processes. ","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/53.txt","8","53","en"
"320","a number of countries may feel the need to proceed by way of enactment of interim measures as was done in post-apartheid south africa or is in process in southern sudan or other countries emerging from protracted conflicts. such measures must, however, give way to more permanent legislative and institutional arrangements if long term sustainability of land policy programmes is to be secured. an emerging practice is to ensure that such arrangements are fully anchored in the relevant country constitution whether interim or final. ","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/53.txt","8","53","en"
"5151","where policy prescriptions touch on issues that require regional convergence or the domestication of international obligations, those dimensions should be factored into the processes of legislating and institutional design. domestic enforcement of international and regional commitments will require that the management of resources otherwise controlled by one member state takes into account the needs of nationals of other member states. land policy development and implementation is one critical area in which domestic legislation and institutions must provide avenues to facilitate the convergence of such interests and needs. efforts to develop a common land resource agenda among sad cc member states is an important initiative in this direction.","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/53.txt","8","53","en"
"892","finally, when considering the steps necessary for the effective implementation of land policies, african governments are advised to appreciate that however technically sound or meticulously implemented their various land policies are these cannot resolve all of africas problems for all time. fresh pressures both internal and external will continue to impact on the land sector after current implementation programmes and processes are completed. such pressures are likely to require radically new policy options, management regimes or technical solutions. it is important, therefore, that governments should put in place realistic time-frames for the review, revision or even replacement of current policies. such reviews should be stakeholder driven, informed by the most up-to-date information on the performance of the land sector as well as by lessons learnt from similar experiences elsewhere.

"213","once the steps outlined in this chapter are taken, there will always be need to monitor and evaluate the impacts of the various components of land policy. this will require the establishment and institutionalization of mechanisms that will enable policy-makers and all stakeholders in the land sector to assess and deal with any such issues including those arising from processes which precede land policy implementation. the next chapter provides a set of guidelines which african countries may wish to use for these purposes.","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/54.txt","8","54","en"

"5181","and the seventh and final principle in the development of effective tacking systems is to determine the overall coherence or consistency of land policy. this involves three main elements, namelyinternal consistency i.e. the compatibility of the key components of the land policy to each other customary rights statutory rights, conservation purposes economic objectives; ii cross-sector consistency i.e. compatibility with and conformity among the key sectors involved in land policy forest, fisheries, agriculture, pastoral activities, mining, urban development; and inter-regional consistency, i.e. whether there is convergence between national land policies and synergy with regional developments and policies. 6.3.2 criteria for application of tracking principles application of tracking principles should conform to at least five criteria. first, the tracking process should be fully participatory. a sound tracking mechanism should be based on clear issues, questions, benchmarks, targets and indicators, developed through a systematic and participatory process. all relevant stakeholders should be involved from the initial stage of the process. every effort should be made to achieve this even if the government is responsible for leading the process. second, an effective tracking mechanism must be run on the basis of transparency, and good governance. besides it should be iterative, and systematic with adequate mechanisms for communication and feedbacks. third, proper tracking indicators should be adaptable to time, space and geographical specificities. fourth, realistic benchmarks, including datelines, must be defined after a consultative process. fifth and finally, it is important to set relevant frequencies for different components of the tracking system. for example inputs and impacts indicators cannot be measured within the same timeframe. while input indicators can be measured annually, budgetary constraints permitting the periodicity of assessment of impacts would depend on available information from research and similar sources. in particular, assessment of changes arising from land policy implementation, such as its effects on livelihoods, economic activities and sustainable natural resource management, would require much more time. indeed such assessments are often long-term processes which require additional investments.

"8113","given its iterative dimension, a good system for tracking land policy development and implementation must have solid links with decision making processes at various levels. this must appear clearly in the pm conceptual model. experiences from other initiatives indicate that short of regular and systematic feedback on the successes, failures and the institutional bottlenecks, no effective political remedy can be applied to re-adjust the whole land policy system. feedbacks should systematically be documented and disseminated to all stakeholders. for large groups, seminars and workshops are adequate means of communication while reports with precise recommendations are preferable for decision makers. inter-sectoral round tables could be also used to share feedback.","pdfs/results/Guidelines on land policy in africa/58.txt","8","58","en"

sloan and sayer, 201 5. although deforestation has declined in some tropical regions as a consequence of effective national and international policies and programs voucher et al., 201 4; newsstand et al., 201 4, losses in forest cover were so high in the past that large-scale reforestation is now needed to safeguard the provision of essential es to society chandon et al., 2016 b; in this article, we use reforestation in the broad sense of returning forest overstorey to land where it has been removed. forest and landscape restoration flr has emerged as a promising activity to recover economic and ecological functionality of large territories deteriorated by the depletion of natural resources in previously forested landscapes sabotage et al., 201 5. a recent assessment has suggested that, globally, 2 billion ha of land present opportunities for some form of flr wri, 201 4. many governments and international organizations are now promoting or drafting programs to undertake flr men et al., 201 3; duding et al., 201 5; chandon et al., 2016 b, at scales of hundreds of millions of hectares. the variety of contexts and implementers creates a variety of approaches being contemplated. some governments are primarily concerned with traditional forms of reforestation, especially planting trees in plantation monocultures to generate goods such as timber or pulpwood xu, 201 1; temper ton et al., 201 4. others are more concerned with forms of reforestation that are able to recover biodiversity and supply the es once provided by the original native forests mole et al., 201 3. these mostly involve more complex, multi-species silvicultural systems lamb, 201 4; restaurant et al., 201 4. both approaches represent a deliberate new land use choice at a particular location. but it is also likely that much of any future increase in tree cover, as in the past, will be achieved through unplanned and uncertain spontaneous natural regeneration in abandoned former agricultural areas aide et al., 201 3; kilroy et al., 201 4. flr could thus include commercial monoculture tree plantations, smallholder woodlots, shifting cultivation, agroforests, restoration plantations and natural regeneration, each of which provide specific outcomes for generating forest products, conserving biodiversity, supplying egs, and safeguarding cultural, religious and aesthetic values of human groups chandon et al., 2016 a. flr differs from ecological or ecosystem restoration, which aims to assist the recovery of native ecosystems to achieve some level of similarity to their pre-disturbance species composition, structure, and functioning ser, 200 4. rather, fir's ultimate goal is to re-shape highly deforested landscapes to better meet human needs, which includes  but is not restricted to  ecological restoration. however, despite the growing enthusiasm for increased reforestation amongst governments and international bodies, current efforts being undertaken by individuals and communities will not be sufficient in itself to achieve the aspirational targets set for flr and associated outcomes for es provisioning, which rely on shifts in land use at larger spatial scales. new policies are then needed to leverage a massive engagement of landholders and unlock the potential of flr to re-shape vast extensions of degraded landscapes. one of the critical factors that will likely influence the success of policies to promote flr is their capacity to provide material benefits to those directly affected, because in developing countries with large numbers of rural poor, reforestation will not be a success unless it also improves livelihoods banes et al., 2015 b. financial impacts to landholders from supplying goods like timber or receiving payments from generating one or more ecosystem services can then make a difference edwards et al., 201 0; calibration et al., 201 2. however, the scale of the reforestation effort being contemplated is likely to be far beyond the financial capacity of many governments, ngos or aid agencies to support its implementation and, thus, to generate material benefits to participants. an alternative or complementary approach is to take advantage of the power of market forces. if flr is able to produce es with a significant financial value in the market system, it may overcome land opportunity costs of degrading activities dominating landscapes and, consequently, replace them by various forms of reforestation. although governments alone may not have financial capacity to support the scale of reforestation contemplated by international flr programs, they can develop policies to support the transformation of flr into a new economic activity, broadening the basis of financial support for its successful implementation. with this in mind, here we explore the potential of markets and their interaction with policies to leverage investment for flr in the tropics. 2. a role of markets in promoting restoration?","pdfs/results/Markets to leverage investment in restoration/2.txt","8","2","en"

"9112","the challenge is to extend such success from deforestation to reforestation, where the objective is not simply to end negative actions but to create large-scale incentives for positive ones. in southeastern brazil, for example, agricultural companies have engaged in forest restoration to comply with the national forest code, as a pre-requisite to obtaining environmental certification for their products and competitive advantages in market rodriguez et al., 201 1. however, such conditions might not apply in most areas targeted for flr. for instance, the current land uses or landholders may not be integrated into the international commodities market. at the national level, legal instruments able to promote restoration may not exist or existing legislation may not be enforced. in addition, the costs of restoration may not be compensated adequately by the financial benefits arising from various forms of environmental certification. therefore, the use of restoration to improve corporate image or access to markets does not seem to be enough to promote flr at the scale needed to face current environmental challenges.","pdfs/results/Markets to leverage investment in restoration/2.txt","8","2","en"
"3113","using markets to leverage investment in forest and landscape restoration in the tropics is noticeable that some of the world's largest reforestation programs e.g. south korea, china, vietnam have been undertaken by government agencies. authoritarian governments, poorly developed private sector, and insufficient market signals to attract private investments are factors potentially related to the predominance of public investments to kick starting large-scale reforestation. but then, once government sponsored restoration programs are underway and have exceeded a critical scale, it may be possible to withdraw these government interventions, like observed now in south chorea lee and miller-rushing, 201 4; temper ton et al., 201 4. by this stage, technologies have been developed and the nature of the risks involved in investing in reforestation is better understood. scale is important. similar to other economic activities, flr may depend on economies of scale, with growing cost advantages with increasing size of operations. in addition to affecting economic efficiency, scale is a key issue for flr because most of its products and services can only be obtained at expected levels if this activity is implemented at very large spatial extents. therefore, flr has to be treated by markets and governments as a big field of activity, similar to agricultural commodities production and infrastructure, and receive the type of incentives dedicated to them. if large-scale flr is viewed as a narrowly focused environmental activity without appropriate consideration of its broad potential to generate jobs and income, alleviate poverty and to deliver es with economic value to society, it is likely to fail. in this context, the sustainable development goals provide a core framework for large-scale application of the flr agenda briggs et al., 201 3.","pdfs/results/Markets to leverage investment in restoration/3.txt","8","3","en"

"1024","all markets require that participants make judgments concerning financial returns and the risks of being involved in that market. most of the initial reforestation undertaken to produce goods such as timber was originally done early in the 20 ht century by governments, often with financing by the world bank, because the private sector regarded the risks of reforestation as being too great. it was only after government forestry departments developed appropriate silvicultural regimes and demonstrated that tree growing could be profitable that the corporate sector became involved lamb, 201 4. even then, many companies relied not just on market conditions but on various forms of government assistance, such as help with acquiring suitable land and reduced taxation and other types of financial assistance enters et al., 200 3. many timber companies reforesting land for the first time c.f. those able to buy former government-owned plantations prefer to grow trees on short rotations for pulpwood because the short timeframe limits their exposure to the risks involved in growing trees on long rotations, and in some cases, such timber companies are legally required to reforest with a single exotic timber species e.g., in malawi. in short, it has taken some time for timber markets to become attractive to the corporate sector and even then, markets alone are sometimes insufficient to attract investments and incentives are needed.","pdfs/results/Markets to leverage investment in restoration/3.txt","8","3","en"

"328","a second problem for small individual growers concerns timber prices. some smaller growers may only produce low-quality logs e.g. with poor form or with large knots, which will generate low prices in local markets. it may make more sense for such growers to invest more in management e.g. pruning, thinning and grow species such as those producing high-value timbers that are able to attract higher prices and sustain longer transport distances. but high-value timber markets can be difficult to locate. where there has been a tradition of using valuable timber species harvested from native forests, their uses and wood properties are often well-known in local markets. however, except for a few well-known hardwoods, such as tectonic or sweetening spp., there is often little recognition of local indigenous high-value species in international markets.","pdfs/results/Markets to leverage investment in restoration/4.txt","8","4","en"
"625","a third problem for individual landholders considering the opportunity costs of tree-growing is that financial returns are often delayed until many years after planting. this might be addressed by using multispecies plantings in which fast-growing species are grown with slower growing species. the former could be harvested within 1 0 years e.g. for firewood, whereas the latter might be higher-value species that take at least several decades to reach a marketable size. harvesting the faster-growing species not only generates an early cash-flow but acts as a thinning to improve the growth of the slower-growing species and reduces the overall risk to the grower by producing goods for several different markets nguyen et al., 201 4. some growers and owners of regrowth forests might also be able to diversify and reduce risks even further by growing non-timber-forest-products such as rattans and food fig. 1. examples of reforestation types, the usual ecosystem goods and services targeted by them, and the socio-ecological contexts in which they are mostly implemented in the tropics. all images are from reforested areas in the atlantic forest of south-eastern brazil. photo credits. pedro h. s. brancalion.","pdfs/results/Markets to leverage investment in restoration/4.txt","8","4","en"

"643","many landowners growing trees for the first time may also have trouble in maximizing the financial returns they are able to get from their plantations lamb, 201 0. poor silviculture can result in substantial losses of potential value beerbohm et al., 201 4. for example, in many smallholder plantations, thinning and pruning is minimal and often is carried out in an ad hoc and opportunistic manner rather than being based on silvicultural principles e.g. see beerbohm et al., 201 4; nguyen et al., 201 4. the economic consequences of poor silviculture can be substantial. for instance, in the philippines it has been estimated that most smallholder woodlots produce merchantable volumes < 4 4% of their site potential, resulting in disillusionment of smallholders le et al., 201 2. in addition, smallholders may not understand the ways that trees are valued e.g. whether trees are sold simply by the number of logs, the diameter or length of each log, by the log volume or as partially sawn log glitches or the effect of location on the log price they are likely to receive e.g. price at the stump, at the road side or at the mill door see banes et al., 2015 a for the factors that affect the value of smallholder timber. intermediaries can play an important role in facilitating relationships between growers and markets box 1. market opportunities and the financial returns from tree-growing are not the only factors affecting the attractiveness of this activity to smallholders. they must also decide how much of their land to devote to this new land use activity and how tree-growing might be linked with their other land-use activities. this obviously depends on such things as the financial return and opportunity costs of tree growing, but might also be dependent on non-market factors such as local community attitudes and what their neighbors think some landholders may be reluctant to begin tree growing if it has not been a traditional land use activity in the past, irrespective of market realities pannell, 199 9; lamb, 201 0. in short, markets for forest products can often trigger reforestation but may sometimes be insufficient. in such cases the financial returns are seen as being too modest while the impediments and risks remain significant. a good part of the problem is due to the fact that many non-corporate landholders are unfamiliar with tree-growing and with formal markets for forest products. this means governments wishing to encourage plantation forestry may need to build technical capacity amongst such landholders, provide financial incentives via cheap loans candor tax breaks, and also assist them to take advantage of existing market opportunities or help them develop new ones. 3.2.1. carbon sequestration the sale of carbon offsets from flr offers one of the clearest market opportunities for ecosystem services newton et al., 201 2. redd+ schemes also now explicit support forest restoration as part of their enhancement of carbon stocks modality. in fact, many of the well known flr programs launched in the last years have paid specific attention to the potential of flr to mitigate global climate change by sequestering carbon in forest and tree biomass, especially the new york declaration on forests announced at the united nations climate summit, which aims to halt deforestation and restore 15 0 million ha of degraded landscapes and forestlands by 202 0, and 35 0 million ha by 203 5 duding et al., 201 5. the intended nationally determined contributions indcs, submitted by countries in advance of the 21 st conference of the parties on climate change also open a new window of opportunity for leveraging carbon payments in the flr context, since governments will have to invest public funds or catalyze private investments in activities promoting climate change mitigation, including reforestation. for instance, the brazilian government set the reforestation commitment of 1 2 million ha as part of its indc, and a national restoration plan has been developed to establish appropriate policy and incentives to up-scale restoration calibration et al., 201 6. in spite of clear potential for carbon markets to leverage investments in flr, payments for carbon credits are not yet available for most landowners. also carbon payments might be able to finance a larger share, or the totality, of cheaper restoration projects based, for instance, on natural regeneration.","pdfs/results/Markets to leverage investment in restoration/6.txt","8","6","en"

"843","3.2.2. watershed protection watershed services are often a primary target of flr programs in developing countries huang et al., 200 9; calibration et al., 201 4; murcia et al., 201 6. in contrast to carbon, payments for watershed services are already part of the economy of most regions supplied by piped water, in the form of water fees. in this case, government regulations have been the first step to allocate funds to pay for watershed services provided by farmers, who have to adopt best land-use practices, including restoration of riparian buffers and other important zones for hydrological functions richards et al., 201 5. in most cases, payments are not calculated based on the direct value of watershed services, which is a methodologically complex issue. rather, programs have focused on compensating farmers for the opportunity costs of changing land use e.g. covering the revenues obtained by beef production in riparian buffer where restoration interventions were established and for transaction and implementation costs e.g. fencing, plantation implementation, fire protection. thus, farmers may not profit beyond compensation payments from reforestation in this context, a clear limitation for expanding flr. leveraging investments in watershed services has been constrained by several major barriers. one of these is that reforestation may need to exceed a threshold area to generate the desired ecosystem service or to offer the most optimal benefit cost ratio e.g., holmes et al., 200 4. to maximize environmental services, this means that many landholders will likely need to be involved and especially those in certain critical landscape locations, such as steep hilly areas. maximizing beneficial outcomes will thus require complex planning and prioritization across large spatial and temporal scales, while accounting for risks wilson et al., 201 1. other barriers includeamounts received per area tend to be very small relative to potential revenue from other sources timber, agriculture, cattle ranching; ii high transaction costs of administering payments of small amounts to many parties; iii difficulties in identifying who should be paid for the service and lack of formal regulations to coordinate transactions; iv monitoring issues, which have to be addressed and protocols agreed upon as a basis for payments; andensuring that the type of reforestation used by all landholders will be sufficient to generate the targeted ecosystem service. in spite of these limitations, typical for new markets and economic activities, ecosystem services have some potential to mobilize investments in watershed flr holmes et al., 200 4; wilson et al., 201 1 especially if nested with the production of forest products, as discussed in the next section. 3.3. bundling ecosystem goods and services payments for ecosystem services may provide an early and continuous cash flow stream with potential to offset land opportunity costs, but the monetary values received tend to be low and are often not enough to offset restoration costs and provide profits to farmers. therefore, there is an important economic synergy in exploring ecosystem services and forest goods in the same project, so bundling them can be a viable solution to support reforestation calibration et al., 201 2. this strategy can also help overcome the problems of high transaction costs of payments for ecosystem services, especially if a single payment is made for all of the services bundled together rather than separate payments for carbon, water, soil protection etc. another promising approach is to bundle es supply with biodiversity conservation. although a key principle of flr is to help conserve biodiversity, most financing is expected to target restoration outcomes with more immediate and direct benefits to people. for instance, the global regions with higher potential to sequester atmospheric carbon are also those with higher biodiversity levels strasbourg et al., 201 0. conservation organizations could then take advantage of market opportunities related to es to mobilize investments to implement flr in priority areas for biodiversity conservation e.g. kilroy et al., 201 4, and use the most appropriate forms of reforestation to achieve this goal. since flr is a multi-purpose approach, bundling es makes more sense than targeting each restoration outcome separately.","pdfs/results/Markets to leverage investment in restoration/7.txt","8","7","en"

"428","8.1. rights-based spatial planning as planning processes are carried out to identify areas where redd+ may support reforestation and forest restoration activities, it will be essential that these be structured in a manner that explicitly addresses the rights of local communities. in particular, an approach will be needed to resolve competing claims between rural communities managing land and forest resources under customary tenure systems, on the one hand, and state agencies and private sector actors relying on national legal codes, on the other. proponents of redd+ can support participatory and accountable planning processes by committing to the principles of free, prior, and informed consent on the part of affected rural communities before redd+-funded spatial planning processes and reforestation projects are approved and funded colchester, 201 0. community involvement in the spatial planning process can be strengthened through the use of participatory mapping of lands and forest resources managed under customary tenure systems.","pdfs/results/Political economy of reforestation/9.txt","8","9","en"
"554","for redd+ to succeed, forest and land rights for rural communities must be clear and must be dependable under national law. given the diversity of institutional arrangements and the large number of claims being made, achieving clear rights in situations which have hitherto been governed under informal common property regimes will undoubtedly take time and resources. if it is to be fair, the process must not be hurried and must be supported by technical resources and funding. given the fundamental importance of clear land and property rights in achieving desirable forest outcomes, it is justified to use redd+ funds to support broader processes of tenure reform and rationalization of state-controlled forest zones.","pdfs/results/Political economy of reforestation/9.txt","8","9","en"
"7210","as mechanisms are created to distribute financial incentives through redd+, care will need to be taken to ensure that they promote the equitable distribution of the programs benefits and not allow these to be captured disproportionately by the sectors most powerful actors. doing so will necessarily require the design of financial disbursement mechanisms to support the flow of redd+ payments to participating rural communities, rather than channeling them primarily through large-scale plantation companies or project developers, who often have close ties to state elites. funds may also be used to support pro-poor policy measures such as participatory planning processes and the strengthening of tenure rights for rural communities and small-holders.","pdfs/results/Political economy of reforestation/9.txt","8","9","en"

"1053","for redd+ to succeed, it will be essential that funds allocated to support reforestation and forest restoration activities and other forest-related mitigation activities be administered in an accountable manner and utilized for their intended purpose. to minimize the loss of funds to corruption and fraud, countries and agencies participating in redd+ will need to ensure that the institutions established to administer program funds have adequate capacity to meet international standards for good financial governance. in addition to capacity for budgeting, accounting, and fiscal administration, this must include robust checks and balances, including strong internal financial controls and routine external audits to ensure that funds are properly managed.","pdfs/results/Political economy of reforestation/9.txt","8","9","en"

"1343","if redd+ is to succeed in mitigating forest-related carbon emissions and enhancing forest carbon stocks, policies supporting perverse incentives for forest conversion must be changed. it is particularly important that reforestation initiatives not be used to justify the large-scale clearing of areas that still have significant forest cover, recognizing that such areas are often classified as degraded secondary forest. this can be achieved by making forestry departments spatial planning processes more transparent and opening land-use planning decisions to public review. redd+ financing for reforestation and forest restoration activities should be restricted to projects that do not involve the removal of natural forest cover prior to replanting, and adequate mechanisms for measuring, reporting, and verification mirv should be put in place to ensure this is the case.","pdfs/results/Political economy of reforestation/9.txt","8","9","en"

"1613","to the extent that redd+ supports the enhancement of carbon stocks through reforestation and forest restoration, there is a pressing need to structure these initiatives so that they will support the livelihoods and well-being of rural smallholders. fundamentally, this must involve the prioritization of tree-planting programs that support not only the participation of, but more importantly, the flow of benefits to rural households and communities. this will require the design of effective institutional mechanisms to ensure that farmers choosing to participate in such programs are able to negotiate with both corporate actors and state agencies in a fair and equitable manner, and that all parties to any agreements can be held mutually accountable.","pdfs/results/Political economy of reforestation/9.txt","8","9","en"
