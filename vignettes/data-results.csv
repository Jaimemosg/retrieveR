Chapter two describes the context which has defined the nature and characteristics of the land question in africa in order to explain the reason why the land sector has not played its primary role in the development process. That role is examined in chapter three. Chapter four sets out the key operational processes which african countries will need to follow in order to develop comprehensive policies that would enable the land sector to fully perform that role. Chapter five analyses the difficulties likely to be met and conditions necessary for the effective implementation of such policies. Chapter six discusses the measures which african countries may wish to put in place to track progress in the development and implementation of those policies. The final chapter is a concluding statement on how member countries of the au might want to use the f&g.",0.32056633395995

In this case, government regulations have been the first step to allocate funds to pay for watershed services provided by farmers, who have to adopt best land-use practices, including restoration of riparian buffers and other important zones for hydrological functions richards et al., 2015. In most cases, payments are not calculated based on the direct value of watershed services, which is a methodologically complex issue.

Thus, farmers may not profit beyond compensation payments from reforestation in this context, a clear limitation for expanding flr. Leveraging investments in watershed services has been constrained by several major barriers. One of these is that reforestation may need to exceed a threshold area to generate the desired ecosystem service or to offer the most optimal benefit cost ratio e.g., holmes et al., 2004. To maximize environmental services, this means that many landholders will likely need to be involved and especially those in certain critical landscape locations, such as steep hilly areas. Maximizing beneficial outcomes will thus require complex planning and prioritization across large spatial and temporal scales, while accounting for risks wilson et al., 2011. Other barriers includeamounts received per area tend to be very small relative to potential revenue from other sources timber, agriculture, cattle ranching; ii high transaction costs of administering payments of small amounts to many parties; iii difficulties in identifying who should be paid for the service and lack of formal regulations to coordinate transactions; iv monitoring issues, which have to be addressed and protocols agreed upon as a basis for payments; andensuring that the type of reforestation used by all landholders will be sufficient to generate the targeted ecosystem service.

The structure of organizational networks  the extent to which networks allow for interaction among organizations within and across ideological and geographic boundaries  can indicate potential opportunities for cooperation on landscape-scale problems. In the arid landscapes of the western united states, where increasingly large wildfires burn irrespective of property boundaries and land designations, organizations involved in the restoration of forests and the protection of property from wildfire could benefit from working together to share information and coordinate strategies. We investigated patterns of interaction among organizations concerned with increasingly uncharacteristic wildfire risk in the eastern cascades correggio of oregon for evidence of structural conditions that create opportunity for cooperation. Through social network analysis of interview data, we found that despite sharing concern about wildfire risk in an area with a common set of ecological conditions, organizations with forest restoration and fire protection goals comprised distinct networks, as did organizations that focused on different geographic areas of the ecoregion. When interpreted through the lens of social capital and organizational theory these findings raise questions about the extent to which the structure of the organizational network reflects capacity to address wildfire risk in fire-prone forests on the ecoregionscale. This study provides insights on the utility of a structural approach for investigating social capacity for landscape-scale planning.",0.391574513829931
