"1","Collective action for poverty reduction","8","Past and present land tenure policies have tended to discriminate against the communal interests of pastoralist communities, and the federal governments policy does not yet accommodate both customary modes of communal land use and emerging trends toward privatization. Collective action on a local scale is insufficient to counter the unmaking of the commons. It needs to be complemented by a land tenure policy that ensures the rights of communal users. Property rights to land and its multiple resources are central in defining incentives for collective action. Neither clans nor customary rule systems are adequate to fully adapt to changed environmental and social conditions. Nor has the state yet found a constructive role in the encounter with pastoralism and clan societies. A redefinition of this relationship is urgently needed. **18**",0.611567314678131,"past and present land tenure policies have tended to discriminate against the communal interests of pastoralist communities, and the federal governments policy does not yet accommodate both customary modes of communal land use and emerging trends toward privatization. collective action on a local scale is insufficient to counter the unmaking of the commons. it needs to be complemented by a land tenure policy that ensures the rights of communal users. property rights to land and its multiple resources are central in defining incentives for collective action. neither clans nor customary rule systems are adequate to fully adapt to changed environmental and social conditions. nor has the state yet found a constructive role in the encounter with pastoralism and clan societies. a redefinition of this relationship is urgently needed.","18"

While inter-clan negotiation may entail access to pasture commons, asset-poor households may fail to capture the associated benefit streams when water access is privatized and prohibitively priced. In that case, clan members may have endowments to some commons resources like pasture, but will not enjoy the entitlement to actual benefit streams because of exclusion from others like water. **18**",0.571753450112649,"de facto privatization and individualization provide some clan members with secure access to resources and additional income, but potentially exclude others. while inter clan negotiation may entail access to pasture commons, asset poor households may fail to capture the associated benefit streams when water access is privatized and prohibitively priced. in that case, clan members may have endowments to some commons resources like pasture, but will not enjoy the entitlement to actual benefit streams because of exclusion from others like water.

However, the current national policies are not immune from the anti-pastoral sentiment. The 2005 national land use proclamation declares that communal rural land holdings may be converted to private holdings if the government finds it necessary. There is also a plan to expand irrigated land in the awash basin. Implementation of such a plan would require evicting pastoralists. Current experiences in non-pastoral areas show that undervaluation of land, large variance between what investors pay and what evicts receive, and failure of evicts to start new livelihoods are critical problems associated with the expansion of investments in rural areas of ethiopia. These problems are attributable to a lack of effective institutions and appropriate governance structures, including lack of clear guidelines on land valuation, marginalization of landholders in the process of land transfers, and a weak organizational setup to administer the transformation process. **15**",0.564152086220328,"1. averting state coercion the coercive expropriation of pastoral land has slowed since 199 1, and afar pastoralists have regained some of their lost rights over their traditional land. however, the current national policies are not immune from the anti pastoral sentiment. the 200 5 national land use proclamation declares that communal rural land holdings may be converted to private holdings if the government finds it necessary. there is also a plan to expand irrigated land in the awash basin. implementation of such a plan would require evicting pastoralists. current experiences in non pastoral areas show that undervaluation of land, large variance between what investors pay and what evicts receive, and failure of evicts to start new livelihoods are critical problems associated with the expansion of investments in rural areas of ethiopia. these problems are attributable to a lack of effective institutions and appropriate governance structures, including lack of clear guidelines on land valuation, marginalization of landholders in the process of land transfers, and a weak organizational setup to administer the transformation process.","15"

"17","Guidelines on land policy in africa","8","Major continual challenge which evolving land policies have to face, especially in sub-saharan africa, is the need to blend tradition and modernity in land rights regimes. In this respect land policies should seek to remove age-old rigidities in traditional structures and systems which tend to discriminate against women while at the same time building on and thereby improving indigenous tenure arrangements. In thus acknowledging the legitimacy of indigenous land rights, land policy processes must also recognize the role of local and community-based land administration management institutions and structures, alongside those of the state. Land policy processes should also seek to provide for the necessary interface between state and indigenous systems, particularly with regard to the certification of land rights, the empowerment of decentralized institutions in land rights administration, and the management of land as a resource at the local level. Colonial legacies which tended to denigrate indigenous land rights systems and suppress and sabotage their evolution and which ignored community land administration structures must now give way to new and innovative policies including the provision of statutory frameworks for the documentation and codification of informal land rights regimes.
