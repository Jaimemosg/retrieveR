"31","Guidelines on land policy in africa","8","An important factor in land administration is to foster good governance of land, natural resources and processes of land use change. Land governance refers to the processes by which decisions regarding access to, and use of, land are made, the manner in which those decisions are implemented, and the way in with conflicting interests in land are resolved or reconciled. Land governance is thus a techno-legal, procedural and political exercise. This is because the process of allocation and enjoyment of land rights cannot be separated from the civil, political and human rights, of the citizenry and are dependent on the political, administrative and professional will to ensure fair treatment and equal opportunities for all.

It is still generally the case, however, that gender discrimination in access to land resources is a serious problem particularly in rural africa. This is both undemocratic and a constraint on economic development. Better and more productive use of land requires that the land rights of women be strengthened through a variety of mechanisms including the enactment of legislation that allows women to enforce documented claims to land within and outside marriage. This should come hand in hand with equal rights for women to inherit and bequeath land, co-ownership of registered land by spouses and the promotion of womens participation in land administration structures. To ensure full enjoyment of land rights, these measures must be part of an ideology which removes issues regarding the land rights of women from the private sphere of marriage and family, and places them in the public domain of human rights. **33**",0.529368124332388,"3.1.4 strengthening the land rights of women throughout africa, agricultural production and preservation of land resources is primarily the responsibility of women and children. it is still generally the case, however, that gender discrimination in access to land resources is a serious problem particularly in rural africa. this is both undemocratic and a constraint on economic development. better and more productive use of land requires that the land rights of women be strengthened through a variety of mechanisms including the enactment of legislation that allows women to enforce documented claims to land within and outside marriage. this should come hand in hand with equal rights for women to inherit and bequeath land, co ownership of registered land by spouses and the promotion of womens participation in land administration structures. to ensure full enjoyment of land rights, these measures must be part of an ideology which removes issues regarding the land rights of women from the private sphere of marriage and family, and places them in the public domain of human rights.","33"
